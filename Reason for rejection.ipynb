SNEDDEN, Administrative Patent Judges.  ADAMS, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL1 This appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 involves claims 1, 6-8, and 14 (App. Br. 3).2  Examiner entered rejections under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) and  35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a).  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We reverse.                                             1 The Real Party in Interest is Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (App. Br. 1). 2 Pending claims 3-5, 9-13, and 15-20 stand withdrawn from consideration as directed to non-elected subject matter (see App. Br. 3). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002126 Application 11/589,995   2STATEMENT OF THE CASE The claims are directed to an endoscopic attachment apparatus.  Claim 1 is representative and is reproduced below:3 1.  An endoscopic attachment apparatus for coupling an endoscope with an endoscopic instrument, comprising: an attachment ring including a ring body having first and second apertures respectively shaped and dimensioned for the receipt of an endoscope and an endoscopic instrument; wherein the attachment ring includes an annular body defining the first aperture and the annular body is provided with an endoscope release mechanism for facilitating release of the endoscope from the attachment ring, wherein the release mechanism includes a tear strip formed along the annular body the tear strip including a tab at an end thereof for engagement by a medical practitioner.  Claims 1 and 14 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by Cocanower.4 Claims 6 and 7 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Cocanower and Whalen.5 Claim 1 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Cocanower and Kojouri.6                                            3 Claim 1 is not accurately reproduced in Appellants\\u2019 Claim Appendix.  The correct version of Appellants\\u2019 claim 1 is reproduced herein and reflects Appellants\\u2019 December 13, 2010 amendment to claim 1, which Examiner entered into the record on February 16, 2011 (see Appellants\\u2019 December 13, 2010 Amendment; Examiner\\u2019s February 16, 2011 Office Action 2: \\xb6 1). 4 Cocanower, US 5,334,167, issued August 2, 1994. 5 Whalen et al., US 2002/0198506 A1, published December 26, 2002. 6 Kojouri, US 7,604,627 B2, issued October 20, 2009. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002126 Application 11/589,995   3Anticipation: ISSUE  Does the preponderance of evidence on this record support Examiner\\u2019s finding that Cocanower teaches Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention? FACTUAL FINDINGS (FF) FF 1. Examiner\\u2019s annotated versions of Cocanower\\u2019s Figures 10 and 11 are reproduced below:           \\u201cFIG. 10 is a fragmentary view of [an] \\u2026 embodiment of \\u2026 [Cocanower\\u2019s] invention having a line of weakness at the attachment between the introducer sheath and the \\u2026 tube\\u201d annotated to identify the parts of Cocanower\\u2019s device Examiner finds to represent the \\u201cRing Body,\\u201d Second Aperture,\\u201d and \\u201cFirst Aperture\\u201d (Cocanower, col. 5, ll. 53-56; Ans. 5 and 7).  \\u201cFIG. 11 is a fragmentary view of the embodiment shown in FIG. 10 having the introducer sheath partially separated from the nasogastric tube\\u201d annotated to identify what Examiner considers to represent Cocanower\\u2019s \\u201cTear Strip Release Mechanism\\u201d (id. at ll. 57-59; Ans. 5 and 7).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002126 Application 11/589,995   4FF 2. Examiner finds that Cocanower teaches an instrument attachment apparatus comprising \\u201can attachment ring including a ring body having first and second apertures \\u2026; wherein the attachment ring includes an annular body \\u2026 provided with a[] \\u2026 release mechanism \\u2026 [that] includes a tear strip formed along the annular body\\u201d (Ans. 5). FF 3. Cocanower teaches that \\u201c[t]he separation of the sheath 40c from the N-G tube 20c may be initiated by the withdrawal of a string \\u2026 or the like\\u201d (Cocanower, col. 8, ll. 3-5).  FF 4. While Examiner asserts that Cocanower\\u2019s \\u201ctear strip include[s] a tab (string) at an end thereof for engagement by a medical practitioner,\\u201d Examiner later concedes that \\u201cCocanower does not expressly teach \\u2026 [a] tear strip including a tab at an end thereof for engagement by a medical practitioner\\u201d (Ans. 5-6; Cf. id. at 10). ANALYSIS  We recognize, but are not persuaded by, Examiner\\u2019s rationale that Cocanower anticipates Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention because  A common practice when employing tear strips is to incorporate a string or some type of pull member along a line of weakness and when the string is pulled, the line of weakness is torn\\u2026.  [I]f the string is located along the line of weakness minimal force is required to tear the line of weakness.  Therefore, the string is being considered a tab formed at the end of the line of weakness.  (Ans. 12-13; Cf. FF 3-4.)  As Appellants explain \\u201c[w]hile the Examiner provides a substantial explanation as to what is disclosed by Cocanower, the explanation is based upon conjecture and is not supported by the cited art\\u201d (Reply Br. 4; see FF 3).  Stated differently, while Examiner posits that a string may, in some instances, serve as a pull tab; Examiner failed to \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002126 Application 11/589,995   5establish an evidentiary basis on this record to support a finding that Cocanower teaches the string is a tab as required by Appellant\\u2019s claimed invention.  CONCLUSION OF LAW The preponderance of evidence on this record fails to support Examiner\\u2019s finding that Cocanower teaches Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention.  The rejection of claims 1 and 14 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by Cocanower is reversed.   Obviousness: ISSUE Does the preponderance of evidence relied upon by Examiner support a conclusion of obviousness? FACTUAL FINDINGS (FF) FF 5. Examiner relies on Cocanower as discussed above (see Ans. 8-10). FF 6. Examiner finds that Cocanower fails to suggest, inter alia, a helical tear away release mechanism and relies on Whalen to make up for this deficiency in Cocanower (id. at 8-9). FF 7. Examiner finds that Cocanower fails to suggest a tear strip including a tab at an end thereof for engagement by a medical practitioner and relies on Kojouri to make up for this deficiency in Cocanower (id. at 10). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002126 Application 11/589,995   6FF 8. Kojouri\\u2019s Figures 5 and 9 are reproduced below:      Kojouri\\u2019s Figures 5 and 9 illustrate a \\u201cnasopharyngeal sheath from different views\\u201d (Kojouri, col. 3, ll. 20-21). FF 9. Kojouri suggests a nasopharyngeal sheath comprising \\u201ctwo rings (22) at its proximal end to facilitate its tearing through the tear-off lines (23),\\u201d wherein \\u201c[t]he rings are attached at the 3 and 9 o\\u2019clock positions and are large enough to be easily grabbed and pulled apart\\u201d (id. at ll. 50-54; see also id. at Abstract (Kojuris\\u2019 system includes a tube and a sheath, wherein \\u201c[t]he diameter of both the tube and the sheath are such that the sheath can accommodate the \\u2026 tube\\u201d)). ANALYSIS The rejection over the combination of Cocanower and Whalen: Claim 6 depends from and further limits the release mechanism of Appellants\\u2019 claim 1 to include a helical tear away mechanism (see Appellants\\u2019 claim 6).7 Based on the combination of Cocanower and Whalen, Examiner concludes that, at the time Appellants\\u2019 invention was made, it would have been prima facie obvious and \\u201ca matter of design choice to provide the apparatus of Cocanower with the helical tear away mechanism of Whalen to                                            7 Appellants\\u2019 claim 7 depends from claim 6. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002126 Application 11/589,995   7enhance the durability of the slit to prevent premature release during insertion\\u201d (Ans. 9).  We are not persuaded.  Examiner failed to establish that Whalen makes up for Cocanower\\u2019s failure to suggest a tear strip that includes a tab at the end thereof for engagement by a medical practitioner as is required by Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention.  The rejection over the combination of Cocanower and Kojouri: Based on the combination of Cocanower and Kojouri, Examiner concludes that, at the time Appellants\\u2019 invention was made, it would have been prima facie obvious \\u201cto provide the apparatus of Cocanower with the release mechanism of Kojouri providing a grip portion for the practitioner to handle to facilitate the tearing of the tear strip\\u201d (Ans. 10).  We are not persuaded.  As Appellants explain, \\u201cKojouri is concerned with peeling a sheath from about a nasogastric tube\\u201d and \\u201cthere does not appear to be any reason why one would want to tear open the introducer sheath 40 of Cocanower as suggested by the Examiner based upon the teachings of Kojouri\\u201d (App. Br. 16; see FF 8-9).   We recognize Examiner\\u2019s alternative rationale, but, like Appellants, find that \\u201cExaminer\\u2019s explanation of a rationale for the suggested modification appears to have been cut off\\u201d or is incomplete (Reply Br. 5; Cf. Ans. 14).  Nevertheless, Examiner reasons that \\u201c[o]ne of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the two rings could be implemented at the end of the line of weakness of Cocanower to separate the \\u2026 tube from the sheath\\u201d (Ans. 14 (emphasis added)).  We are not persuaded.  Rather than placing the tab/ring at the end of a tear-off line, Kojouri suggests that the rings are arranged on the sheath in an orientation that is perpendicular to, e.g., at the 3 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002126 Application 11/589,995   8and 9 o\\u2019clock positions relative to, Kojouri\\u2019s tear-off lines, thereby facilitating the peeling of Kojouri\\u2019s sheath into two halves along the tear-off lines (see FF 9-10).  Examiner failed to articulate how or why a person of ordinary skill in this art would modify the orientation of Kojouri\\u2019s rings about a tear-off line, or line of weakness, i.e. from a position that is perpendicular to a tear-off line to a position that is at the end of a tear-off line, and then apply this modification of Kojouri to the end of Cocanower\\u2019s line of weakness to facilitate the separation of Cocanower\\u2019s tube from the sheath (see Ans. 14).  As Appellants explain, Cocanower\\u2019s sheath \\u201cis not positioned about the \\u2026 tube\\u201d as it is in Kojouri and such a modification would serve only to complicate Cocanower\\u2019 device (see App. Br. 16; Reply Br. 5).  \\u201c[R]ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere conclusory statements; instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness.\\u201d  In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006). CONCLUSION OF LAW The preponderance of evidence relied upon by Examiner fails to support a conclusion of obviousness.   The rejection of claims 6-7 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Cocanower and Whalen is reversed.  The rejection of claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Cocanower and Kojouri is reversed.   REVERSED  cdc \\x0c'},\n",

FREDMAN, Administrative Patent Judges.  MILLS, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL  This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134.  The Examiner has rejected the claims for obviousness.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554 Application 11/924,350  2 STATEMENT OF CASE Claims 11, 19, 22 and 23 are representative and read as follows:  11. A fermentation process comprising adding to a growth medium a bacterial strain having a periplasmic space, wherein the bacteria produce polyhydroxyalkanoates and wherein the bacteria express a heterologous nuclease gene or a genetically modified homologous nuclease gene, the product of which is secreted into the periplasmic space in an amount effective to degrade at least 95% of all of the nucleic acid released following lysis of the bacterial cells in less than 24 hours.  19.  The process of claim 11 wherein the nuclease gene is integrated into a host strain selected from the group consisting of Ralstonia eutropha, Methylobacterium organophilum, Methylobacterium extorquens, Aeromonas caviae, Azotobacter vinelandii, Alcaligenes latus, Pseudomonas oleovorans, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas acidophila, Pseudomonas resinovorans, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella.  22. The process of claim 11 wherein the bacterial strain expresses a homologous nuclease, further comprising mutating the bacterial strain and screening for bacteria expressing enhanced nuclease activity.  23. The process of claim 11 wherein the bacteria expresses a homologous nuclease, further comprising genetically engineering the nuclease to enhance nuclease activity.

Grounds of Rejection Claim 11, 12, 14-16, 19, 22, and 23 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Greer, Leung, Atkinson, and Lee in view of Liebl or Miller. FINDINGS OF FACT The Examiner\\u2019s findings of fact are set forth in the Answer at pages 4-10.                                              1  We note that page 7 of the Answer includes a typographical error indicating that, \\u201cAtkinson et al. teach that Alcaligenes eutrophus (Ralstonia eutrophus) has been studied in detail due to its ability to accumulate large amounts of P(3HB) (i.e. ability to grow to cell densities of approximately 85 g/l and produce P(3HB) at 61.5 g/l, or 80% wt/wt of dry cell mass, page 30 through 32).\\u201d  This reference citation, however, is from Lee page 32, section 3.2, not Atkinson pages 30-32. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554  Application 11/924,350    4Discussion   ISSUE The Examiner concludes that   One of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to genetically engineer a Alcaligenes eutrophus (Ralstonia eutrophus) bacterial strain to express the Staphylococcal aureus nuclease as taught by Liebl et al. or Miller et al. and Leung and Swartz, or a homologous nuclease gene that has been modified to enhance nuclease activity, so that this bacterial strain would produce and excrete the nuclease into the bacterial periplasmic space as part of a fermentation process for the synthesis of industrially important molecules, such as polyhydroxy-alkanoates. A nuclease excreted into the periplasmic space as a result of such a genetically engineered bacterial strain would inherently result in the degradation of at least 95% of all the nucleic acid released following lysis of the cells in less than 24 hours. The basis of this is that as shown by Leung and Swartz, in the data shown in Table 3 of US 6,258,560, those harvested broths in which nuclease was expressed in the periplasmic space showed significantly less viscosity relative to those harvested broths in which no nuclease was expressed even without 37\\xb0C incubation. The motivation for producing a nuclease by a genetically engineered bacterial strain used in the fermentation process is to reduce the amount of nucleic acids in the medium which result in an increase in the viscosity of the medium, causing problems in the downstream processing steps, as taught by Greer et al. and Leung and Swartz. Greer et al. give further motivation for genetically engineering a bacterial strain to express a nuclease, because they teach that purified preparations of nucleases are expensive and a bacterial strain that was genetically engineered to express a nuclease activity would not require an external nuclease or hydrogen peroxide to be added to the fermentation. One would have had a reasonable expectation of success because both Liebl et al. and Miller et al. were able to express functional Staphylococcal aureus nuclease in different bacterial species, specifically Corynebacterium glutamicum and Bacillus subtilis and Liebl et al. teach that the Staphylococcal aureus nuclease is a heat-stable biochemically well characterized enzyme. One would have been further motivated to engineer the bacterial strain to secrete the nuclease into the growth medium in an effective amount to enhance the recovery \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554  Application 11/924,350    5of product from the growth medium. Alternatively one would have been motivated to engineer a homologous nuclease to increase its nuclease activity for the same reasons as stated above for the introduction of the heterologous Staphylococcal nuclease.  (Ans. 8-9.)  Appellants argue that, \\u201c[n]one of the prior art recognizes that the use of the gram negative organism in combination with expression of high levels of nuclease, which then accumulates within the periplasmic space, provides a significant economic advantage.\\u201d  (App. Br. 9.)   Appellants rely on the Declaration of Peoples as evidence of the economic advantage associated with the claimed method. (App. Br. 32.) Appellants further argue that, to the extent that the Examiner relies on Leung for providing a motivation to express nuclease which is secreted into the periplasmic space, such reliance is misplaced because Leung is not prior art to this application.  (App. Br. 11.)  Appellants argue that, \\u201c[n]one of Miller of Liebl would lead one to express nuclease into the periplasmic space.\\u201d  (App. Br. 24.) Appellants provide separate arguments for claim 19-23 on page 28-30 of the Brief. The issue is:  Does the cited prior art support the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection?  PRINCIPLES OF LAW \\u201cIn rejecting claims under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103, the examiner bears the initial burden of presenting a prima facie case of obviousness. Only if that burden is met, does the burden of coming forward with evidence or \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554  Application 11/924,350    6argument shift to the applicant.\\u201d In re Rijckaert, 9 F.3d 1531, 1532 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (citations omitted). In order to determine whether a prima facie case of obviousness has been established, we consider the factors set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17 (1966): (1) the scope and content of the prior art; (2) the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue; (3) the level of ordinary skill in the relevant art; and (4) objective evidence of nonobviousness, if present. \\u201cThe combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results.\\u201d KSR Int\\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416 (2007). The priority statute, 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 120, Benefit of earlier filing date in the United States, recites that An application for patent for an invention disclosed in the manner provided by section 112(a) (other than the requirement to disclose the best mode) in an application previously filed in the United States, or as provided by section 363 of this title, which is filed by an inventor or inventors named in the previously filed application shall have the same effect, as to such invention, as though filed on the date of the prior application, if filed before the patenting or abandonment of or termination of proceedings on the first application or on an application similarly entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the first application and if it contains or is amended to contain a specific reference to the earlier filed application. [emphasis added.]   ANALYSIS We have decided this case in conjunction with Appeal No. 2012-005719, Application No. 10/607,903.  In addition, we have reviewed our \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554  Application 11/924,350    7Decisions in related Appeal Nos. 2002-001357, Application No. 09/281,363, and 2003-001996, Application No. 09/456,940.  We further acknowledge that the claims before us include modifications not present in our earlier Decisions. In the present case, for the most part, we agree with the Examiner\\u2019s fact finding, statement of the rejection and responses to Appellants\\u2019 arguments as set forth in the Answer.  We find that the Examiner has provided evidence to support a prima facie case of obviousness for the subject matter of claim 11 and its dependent claims, except claim 22.  We provide the following additional comment to argument set forth in the Answer.  Appellants argue that, \\u201c[n]one of the prior art recognizes that the use of the gram negative organism in combination with expression of high levels of nuclease, which then accumulates within the periplasmic space, provides a significant economic advantage.\\u201d  (App. Br. 9.)   Appellants rely on the Declaration of Peoples as evidence of the economic advantage associated with the claimed method.  (App. Br. 32.) We are not persuaded by Appellants\\u02bc argument or Declaration evidence. The Examiner acknowledges that  the references do not specifically disclose secretion of nuclease into the periplasmic space of gram negative bacteria, this limitation previously argued by appellants is considered to be an inherent property of the bacterial cells made obvious by Atkinson et al. [sic, Lee; see note 1 above], which express the Staphylococcal aureus nuclease as taught by Liebl et al. or Miller et al. The inherency of the secretion of the nuclease in \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554  Application 11/924,350    8the obvious bacterial strain is based upon the reference of Boynton. . .    (Ans. 19.)  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s response to this argument set forth on pages 19-20 of the Answer, and find acceptable the Examiner\\u2019s use of Boynton to show that the R. eutropha cells taught by Lee inherently secrete nuclease into the periplasmic space. With respect to the claimed level of nuclease production, secretion and degradation, we agree with the Examiner that, in Boynton,   PHA producing R. eutropha cells were generated using the same nuclease encoding gene taught by Leibl [sic] et al. above (See Boynton et al. Materials AND Methods, p 1524 and Figure 3, p 1527 and supporting text p 1526).  Boynton et al. teach that the transformant \\u201cR. eutropha secreted nuclease into the periplasm but not into the growth medium\\u201d (p1526, Construction of nuclease integrants of other PHA producers).  Thus the bacterial strain that is obvious over the above references inherently produces the nuclease such that it is secreted into the periplasmic space.   Boynton et al. further characterize the nuclease activity of the periplasmic nuclease of the transformed R. eutropha cells in the data provided in Figure 3 and the supporting text, in which they show the result of chromosomal DNA treatment with periplasmic fractions of R. eutropha MBX917 (::nuckan) (lane 4) and R. eutropha NCIMB40124HD untransformed parent strain (lane 5) at 37\\xb0C for 1 hour.  As is evident from the results of Figure 3, after only one hour of incubation with the transformed R. eutropha periplasmic fraction, all of the visible high molecular weight DNA was digested to smaller molecular weight fragments.  Based upon this level of digestion of high molecular weight chromosomal DNA for only one hour at 37\\xb0C, clearly the level of nuclease produced in the transformed R. eutropha strain \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554  Application 11/924,350    9would digest at least 95% of all nucleic acid released following lysis of the bacterial cells in a 24 hour period.  (Ans. 19-20.)  Therefore, consistent with our Decision in Appeal No. 2002-1357 (page 7), we find that Appellants have not provided sufficient evidence to show that the nuclease levels of Miller, Liebl, and Leung would not provide the level of product recovery contemplated by claim 11 on appeal.  We are unconvinced by Dr. Peoples\\u2019 Declaration which argues that the expense and use of nucleases is prohibitive.  (Declaration 2.)  The fact that Greer and Dr. Peoples\\u2019 Declaration found that the use of nucleases is expensive does not mean that the prior art was not aware of the viscosity problem associated with nucleic acids and fermentation product recovery, or unaware that nucleases could be used in place of peroxide to address the viscosity problem.  The process made obvious by the cited references involves expressing a nuclease gene in recombinant cells, not buying purified nucleases to add to the medium.  Appellants have not explained why the expense of commercially available nucleases would discourage a skilled artisan from practicing the method suggested by the prior art.     Appellants further argue that, to the extent that the Examiner relies on Leung for providing a motivation to express nuclease which is secreted into the periplasmic space, such reliance is misplaced because Leung is not prior art to this application.  (App. Br. 11.)  Appellants argue that, \\u201c[n]one of Miller of [sic] Liebl would lead one to express nuclease into the periplasmic space.\\u201d  (App. Br. 24.) We are not persuaded by Appellants\\u02bc argument that Leung is not prior art to the present application.  In particular, Appellants argue that \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554  Application 11/924,350    10This application was filed on October 25, 2007, as a continuation of pending U.S. Serial No. 10/607,903 filed July 27, 2003, which is a continuation of U.S. Serial No. 09/456,940, filed December 7, 1999, now abandoned, which is a divisional of U.S. Serial No. 09/281,363, filed March 30, 1999, now abandoned, which claims priority to U.S. Serial No.  60/079,938, filed March 30, 1998. Thus, this application has a priority date of March 10 [sic, 30?], 1998, as evidenced by the official filing receipt (a copy of which was attached to the Evidence Appendix of the Appeal Brief).  The examiner has, for the first time on appeal, denied applicants\\' claim to priority to U.S.S.N. 60/079,938 (\"the \\'938 application\") filed on March 30, 1998, for the aspect of the invention drawn to \"a genetically modified homologous nuclease gene, the product of which is secreted into the periplasmic space\".  (Reply Br. 2-3.)  However, we agree with the Examiner that Appellants initial submission that Leung (which has a priority date of 10/28/1998) is not prior art to this application, is not persuasive on the basis that appellants do not recieve [sic] priority for that aspect of the invention that is drawn to \"a genetically modified homologous nuclease gene, the product of which is secreted into the periplasmic space ... \" to provisional application 60/079,938 filed on 3/30/1998.  Thus the earliest filing date for which appellants are granted priority is 3/30/1999.  Thus Leung is prior art to the claimed invention. [emphasis added.]  (Ans. 10.)   This finding of lack of priority to the March 30, 1998 filing date of the present application for the \\u201cgenetically modified homologous nuclease gene, the product of which is secreted into the periplasmic space,\\u201d is \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554  Application 11/924,350    11consistent with our Decision in Appeal No. 2003-19962 where we found that there was no written descriptive support in the Specification under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7112 for \\u201ca single bacterial strain which comprises a genetic modification of a homologous nuclease gene.\\u201d  (2003-1996 Decision 4-6.)  Thus, the March 30, 1998 priority document fails to meet the requirements of 35 U.S.C. \\xa7\\xa7 120, 112, for the claimed subject matter and Appellants are not entitled to the priority date of March 30, 1998.  We have reviewed the passages of the priority application reproduced by Appellants in the Reply Br. Pages 6-7, however, we find no written description under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112 of a single bacterial strain which comprises a genetic modification of a homologous nuclease gene.  Appellants do not argue the specific disclosure of Leung on the merits, and, therefore, we find that Leung is prior art to the pending claims and has not been rebutted by Appellants.  Claims 19 - 23 Appellants provide separate argument for claim 19-23 on page 28-30 of the Brief. With respect to claim 19, Appellants argue that \\u201c[n]o reason is provided for why one would go to the trouble of integrating the nuclease into the chromosome\\u201d (App. Br. 28).  However, claim 19 requires only that the                                            2 As noted above, the application on appeal is a continuation of application 10/607,903, which is a continuation of application 09/456,940.  The \\u2018940 application was the subject of Appeal No. 2003-1996.  The application on appeal therefore shares the same Specification with the application in Appeal No. 2003-1996. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554  Application 11/924,350    12\\u201cnuclease gene is integrated into a host strain,\\u201d not that it is integrated into the chromosome of the host strain.  We interpret claim 19 as encompassing integration of a plasmid into the host strain, and not requiring integration into the host strain DNA.  Appellants admit on page 11 of the Brief that the combination of Atkinson with Liebl or Miller discloses bacterial strains with an integrated plasmid in the host strain which expresses a heterologous nuclease gene.  We affirm the rejection of claim 19.  For the reasons set forth with respect to claim 11 herein and in the Examiner\\u2019s Answer we also affirm the rejection of claim 23.  Claim 22 Claim 22 recites that, \\u201cthe bacterial strain expresses a homologous nuclease, further comprising mutating the bacterial strain and screening for bacteria expressing enhanced nuclease activity.\\u201d   Appellants argue that,  the Examiner has not identified how the cited art renders the limitation of claim 22 obvious.  Further, the Examiner\\'s discussion of Leung (even if Leung were relevant, does not address how Leung renders this limitation obvious).  There is nothing about mutation in Leung.    (Reply Br. 13-14.) We agree with Appellants and do not find that the Examiner has provided supporting evidence in the prior art of mutating a bacterial strain expressing a homologous nuclease gene in order to enhance nuclease activity.  The rejection of claim 22 is reversed.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004554  Application 11/924,350    13CONCLUSION OF LAW The cited references support the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection, except that the rejection of claim 22 is reversed.

HOELTER, ANNETTE R. REIMERS and CARL M. DeFRANCO, Administrative Patent Judges.  REIMERS, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE Serge Baumert and Philippe Mugg (Appellants) appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from the Examiner\\u2019s decision to reject under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a): (1) claims 1-8, 10-17 and 19 as unpatentable over Kais  (US 6,177,205 B1; iss. Jan. 23, 2001), Bhadeshia (US 5,879,474; iss. Mar. 9, 1999) and Yokoyama1 (JP 2001098342 A; pub. Apr. 10, 2001); and (2) claims 9 and 18 as unpatentable over Kais, Bhadeshia, Yokoyama and Appellants\\u2019 Admitted Prior Art (AAPA) (see Ans. 5, citing Spec. p. 4, ll. 2-7).  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We AFFIRM.  CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention \\u201crelates in particular to the connection between a switch such as a crossing frog and a section of rail consisting for example of a running line rail made from carbon steel.\\u201d  Spec. 12; fig. 1.  Claims 1 and 11 are independent. Claim 1 is illustrative of the claimed invention and is reproduced below: 1. A process for the manufacture of a stretch of rail, comprising: directly welding a railway switch element to at least one length of rail by flash welding and forging to produce said stretch of rail,                                            1 Appellants refer to the Yokoyama reference as \\u201cJP \\u2018342.\\u201d  See App. Br.  3.  The Examiner refers to the Yokoyama reference as the \\u201cJapanese reference.\\u201d  See Ans. 3-4.  To maintain consistency, we shall refer to the Yokoyama reference as \\u201cJP \\u2018342.\\u201d 2 Appellants\\u2019 Specification does not provide line or paragraph numbering.  Accordingly, reference will only be made to the page number. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  3 said railway switch element being made from high-alloy steel, in which manganese has a content equal to at least 5% by weight, and said at least one length of rail being made from a medium-alloy steel having a carbon content less than 0.55% by weight and which is a bainitic steel.  ANALYSIS Obviousness over Kais, Bhadeshia and Yokoyama - Claims 1-8, 10-17 and 19 Appellants do not present separate arguments for independent claims 1 and 11.  App. Br. 4-9.  Appellants do not present additional arguments for dependent claims 2-8, 10, 12-17 and 19 separate from those directed against the rejection of independent claims 1 and 11.  Id.  Accordingly, Appellants have argued claims 1-8, 10-17 and 19 as a group for purposes of the rejection of those claims under \\xa7 103(a).  Claim 1 is representative of the group and is selected for review, with claims 2-8, 10-17 and 19 standing or falling with claim 1.  See 37 C.F.R. 41.37(c)(1)(vii)(2011).   Independent claim 1 recites a process for the manufacture of a stretch of rail including \\u201cdirectly welding a railway switch element to at least one length of rail by flash welding and forging.\\u201d  App. Br., Clms. App\\u2019x.  Appellants contend that:  Besides welding frog point 12 with rail 14 together directly by electron-beam welding, Kais teaches an alternative way which uses an intermediate layer made of nickel based alloy, by flash butt welding, to weld the high alloy steel and the carbon steel, where the carbon steel has a mixed structure with at least bainite (preferably 30% to 40%) and pearlite (preferably at least 50%). . . .   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  4 . . . JP \\u2018342 teaches that the joinability is improved in flash butt welding.  Therefore, even if one skilled in the art combines Kais with JP '342, the combination would then still be replacing the pearlite contents with the bianitic steel via the intermediate layer during the flash butt welding process. . . .  Bhadeshia pertains to a method of producing an essentially carbide-free bainitic steel. . . .  As is well known in the art, the problem of weldability is never a problem \\u201cin general\\u201d, but always reduces to specific problems: weldability of a particular steel on another particular steel.  It is never possible to use a general teaching about welding of a carbon steel on the same carbon steel to deduce information on the welding of the same carbon steel on a high alloyed manganese steel. Especially, Kais prefers to use the structure which has at least 50% pearlite content. . . .  . . . as neither Bhadeshia nor JP \\u2018342 give information about welding of a carbon steel on an high alloyed carbon steel, the man which is skilled in the art has no reason to search a solution which is different from the solution of Kais, i.e., to use an insert made of nickel based alloy.  App. Br.  7-9 (emphasis in original); see also Reply Br. 3-6.   Appellants\\u2019 arguments are not persuasive.  Appellants\\u2019 arguments do not address the Examiner\\u2019s proposed combination of Kais, JP \\u2018342 and Bhadeshia.  Ans. 3-5.  As pointed out by the Examiner,  indirect welding through using a metal insert is actually another alternative embodiment of Kais that forms no part of the [E]xaminer\\u2019s combination applied in the [] grounds of rejection. In the [] ground of rejection, the direct welding embodiment instead of indirect welding \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  5 embodiment of Kais is applied as the starting basis of the rejection because the instant claimed invention requires a direct welding.  Ans. 7 (emphasis added).  In this case, the Examiner found that   Kais discloses a stretch of rail comprising switch element 12 made of high alloy steel including manganese content of 10-20%, connected directly to the lengths of carbon steel rails 14,16 that has pearlite content by welding without deposition of metal (see for example claim 1 of Kais patent), i.e. by electron-beam welding.  Ans. 3.  The Examiner found that Bhadeshia (1) \\u201cdescribes a bainitic steel rail without carbide or carbide-free, and the bainitic steel rail has the material composition as recited in instant claims\\u201d (Ans. 4 citing Bhadeshia, col. 3, ll. 4-15); and (2) discloses that \\u201cbainitic steel rail is preferred over pearlitic steel rail for its enhanced wear resistance, rolling contact fatigue, toughness, weldability, and the advantages of elimination of heat treatment operations during both production and after welding heat treatment\\u201d (id.  citing Bhadeshia, col. 1, ll. 15-21, col. 2, ll. 17-21, col. 2, l. 66 - col. 3, l. 3).  The Examiner also found that JP \\u2018342 \\u201csuggests the use of bainitic rail over the conventional pearlitic rail because bainitic steel has excellent wear resistance and damage resistance.\\u201d  Ans. 4 (citing English abstract of JP \\u2018342).  The Examiner concluded that  [i]n view of Bhadeshia and [JP \\u2018342], it would have been obvious to one skilled in the art to substitute a bainitic steel rail, such as the steel rail of Bhadeshia, for the pearlitic steel rail of Kais because both Bhadeshia and [JP \\u2018342] indicate the preferences of bainitic steel rails over pearlitic steel rails for the above described advantages.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  6 Id.  The Examiner further took Official Notice that \\u201cflash butt welding and flash welding and forging [as claimed in the subject invention] are considered to be equivalent because they are recognized in the art to be similar.\\u201d  Ans. 4-5.  The Examiner further concluded that  [i]n view of the [JP \\u2018342], it would have been obvious to one skilled in the art to use either flash butt welding or flash welding and forging instead of electron-beam welding for welding the bainitic steel rails in the structure of Kais, as modified, because flash butt welding or the equivalence thereof (i.e. the flash welding and forging) provides an enhanced joinability for bainitic steel as suggested in the English abstract of the [JP \\u2018342].  Ans. 5.  The Examiner also reasoned that   electronic beam welding (described in Kais) and flash welding (described in the [JP \\u2018342]) are known forms of welding, and the concept of trying one known type of welding (e.g. flash welding) from among a couple of known types of welding (e.g. electronic beam welding and flash welding) would fall in another KSR rationale that supports obviousness, i.e. \\u201cobvious to try\\u201d - choosing a finite reasonable number of identified, predictable solutions, with a reasonable expectation of success.  For example, it would have been obvious to one skilled in the art to try a test weld by using each of the two known types of welding, and then to finally choose the type of welding that produces a stronger weld joint.    Ans. 7-8.  Moreover, we note that Appellants\\u2019 Specification states that \\u201c[t]he weld 16 is obtained for example by flash welding and forging according to a conventional welding cycle which is known per se.  As a variant, the weld \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  7 can be obtained by induction, by friction, by electron beams, by laser or by any other high-energy beam.\\u201d   Spec. 5; fig. 1.  Appellants have not apprised us of error regarding the Examiner\\u2019s stated reasoning or conclusions of obviousness.  Appellants contend that  it must be emphasized that Kais discloses a direct welding method (electron-beam welding) and an indirect welding method using an intermediate layer without indicating a preference for one of the two methods (cf. column 2, lines 1-7).  Therefore, Kais does not teach or infer a person skilled in the art to choose the direct welding method especially as Kais discusses in detail throughout the whole document the composition of an intermediate layer material used for indirect welding and therefore seems to favor the indirect welding method.  Kais thus in effect teaches away from the present invention.    Reply Br. 4.    Appellants\\u2019 arguments are not persuasive.  Appellants do not point to any passage in Kais that \\u201ccriticize[s], discredit[s] or otherwise discourage[s]\\u201d the use of direct welding techniques.  In re Fulton, 391 F.3d 1195, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (prior art does not teach away from claimed subject matter merely by disclosing a different solution to a similar problem unless the prior art also criticizes, discredits or otherwise discourages the solution claimed).  To the contrary, Kais discloses  [i]t is proposed in accordance with the invention that the rail parts consisting of differing materials, one of which is carbon steel and the other austenitic manganese steel, . . . be joined either directly using electron-beam welding methods or \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  8 indirectly via an intermediate layer comprising a nickel based alloy. . . The type of join represents a simplification in comparison with the prior art, since in accordance with the invention there is the possibility of joining a rail consisting of austenitic manganese steel directly to the second rail part of carbon steel, in order to then treat the unit thus formed as a whole. The use of electron-beam welding has the advantage of directly joining the austenitic manganese steel to carbon steel. Alternatively, a join can be made using an intermediate layer in the form of a nickel-based alloy.  Kais, col. 2, ll. 1-19 (emphasis added).  In other words, Kais discloses two different methods of joining the austenitic manganese steel to carbon steel, i.e., directly via electron-beam welding or, alternatively, via an intermediate layer in the form of a nickel-based alloy.  Thus, we find that the disclosure of Kais does not teach away from Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention. Appellants\\u2019 contend that JP \\u2018342 (1) \\u201cdoes not specify the material to test the joinability and at least is silent about welding a carbon steel on a high alloyed steel\\u201d (App. Br. 8);  (2) \\u201cneither discloses nor suggests that flash butt welding or the equivalence thereof provides an enhanced joinability over electron-beam welding.  Therefore, JP \\u2018342 does not teach or infer to a person skilled in the art to replace electron-beam welding as suggested by Kais by flash butt welding or the equivalence thereof\\u201d (Reply Br. 4-5); and (3) \\u201cdoes not disclose flash butt welding of bainitic steel with a high-alloy steel having a manganese content equal to at least 5% by weight\\u201d (Reply Br. 5). Appellants\\u2019 arguments are not persuasive.  Appellants\\u2019 arguments are individual attacks on the references rather than a challenge to the Examiner\\u2019s \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  9 combination of the teachings of the references.  See In re Merck & Co., 800 F.2d 1091 (Fed. Cir. 1986); In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413 (CCPA 1981) (one cannot show nonobviousness by attacking references individually where the rejections are based on combinations of references).   Appellants contend that \\u201cthe present invention shows unexpected results that would fully rebut any unpatentability that could be alleged.  This includes the unexpected and advantageous clean line of fusion between the bainitic steel and the manganese steel, as can be seen in Figure 2 of the application.\\u201d  App. Br. 9; see also Reply Br. 3. Appellants\\u2019 arguments are not persuasive for the following reasons.  First, Appellants have not come forth with any objective evidence of non-obviousness (i.e., secondary considerations).  Specifically, Appellants have not provided any objective evidence of unexpected results, commercial success, long-felt but unsolved needs, or failure of others.  In re Rouffet, 149 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 1998); U.S. Surgical Corp. v. Ethicon, Inc., 103 F.3d 1554, 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  Merely stating that \\u201cunexpected results\\u201d have been obtained is not sufficient to rebut the rejection; factual evidence must be provided.  In re De Blauwe, 736 F.2d 699, 705 (Fed. Cir. 1984).   Further, when an article is said to achieve unexpected (i.e., superior) results, those results must logically be shown as superior compared to the results achieved with other articles.  Appellants acknowledge that (1) \\u201cKais discloses a direct welding method (electron-beam welding)\\u201d  (Reply Br. 4; see also App. Br. 7); (2) \\u201cJP \\u2018342 teaches that the joinability is improved in flash butt welding\\u201d (App. Br. 8); (3) \\u201cJP \\u2018342 compares bainitic steel with pearlitic steel and points out that bainitic steel has a better joinability than pearlitic steel\\u201d (Reply Br. 5); and (4) \\u201cBhadeshia pertains to a method of \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  10 producing an essentially carbide-free bainitic steel\\u201d (App. Br. 8).  Appellants have not persuasively explained how \\u201ca simple substitution of one known element (e.g. bainitic steel, and flash welding) for another (e.g. pearlitic steel, electronic beam welding)\\u201d would yield anything other than predictable results, as proposed by the Examiner.  Ans. 6.  See KSR Int\\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416 (2007) (\\u201cwhen a patent claims a structure already known in the prior art that is altered by the mere substitution of one element for another known in the field, the combination must do more than yield a predictable result.\\u201d (citation omitted)).  In other words, Appellants have not provided any objective evidence to show that Appellants\\u2019 invention achieves \\u201cunexpected results\\u201d as compared to the device of Kais, Bhadeshia and JP \\u2018342. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1 and claims 2-8, 10-17 and 19, which fall with claim 1, as unpatentable over Kais, Bhadeshia and JP \\u2018342 is sustained.   Obviousness over Kais, Bhadeshia, Yokoyama and AAPA  - Claims 9 and 18 Appellants have not presented separate arguments for dependent claims 9 and 18.  App. Br. 10.  Therefore, Appellants have argued claims 9 and 18 as a group for purposes of the rejection of those claims under \\xa7 103(a).  Claim 9 is representative of the group and is selected for review, with claim 18 standing or falling with claim 9.  See 37 C.F.R. 41.37(c)(1)(vii)(2011).   Claim 9 recites \\u201cwherein the switch element made from the high-alloy steel has a hardness between 170 and 230 HB.\\u201d  App. Br., Clms. App\\u2019x.  The Examiner found that  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  11 Kais does not disclose the specific hardness of the switch element.  In the lines 2-7, page 4 of the instant specification, there is a switch element made of a material, which is similar to that of Kais, that is well known under the name of HADFIELD and has hardness between 170 and 230 HB.  Therefore, it would have been obvious to one skilled in the art to use a material having similar hardness to that of the prior art switch element described in the instant specification, for forming the switch element of Kais so as to achieve the expected structural integrity thereof.  Ans. 5-6.  Appellants contend  [t]he Detailed Description section of the specification includes a reference to the steel known as HADFIELD and to it hardness of between 170 and 230. . . . However by being in the Detailed Description section this is clearly part of the disclosure of the invention. Utilizing this disclosure as prior art without an admission of  prior art is impermissible.   App. Br. 10.    Appellants\\u2019 argument is not persuasive.  Appellants contention that they did not make an express admission of prior art is undercut by their statement that \\u201c[t]his is a steel which is well known under the name of HADFIELD.\\u201d  Spec. 4.  It is this express acknowledgement by Appellants that HADFIELD steel is well known that the Examiner relied upon.  Ans. 5-6.  However Appellants\\u2019 wish to categorize this statement, it is axiomatic that admitted prior art in an Applicants\\u2019 Specification may be used in determining the patentability of a claimed invention and that consideration \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  12 of the prior art cited by the Examiner may include consideration of the admitted prior art found therein.  In re Nomiya, 509 F.2d 566, 570-71 (CCPA 1975); In re Davis, 305 f.2d 501, 503 (CCPA 1962).  The Examiner\\u2019s finding is supported by the further teaching in Appellants\\u2019 Specification that alloyed steel containing between 12% and 14% by weight of manganese and having a hardness between 170 and 230 HB is well known under the name of HADFIELD.  Spec. 4.  We also note that Kais discloses that the austenitic manganese steel (switch element) has a manganese content \\u201cpreferably in the range between 10 and 20 % by weight.\\u201d  See Kais, col. 2, ll. 3-5; see also Ans. 3.  In this case, because Kais\\u2019 switch element has a manganese content in the range between 10 and 20 % by weight, which encompasses a manganese content in the range between 12% and 14% by weight as described in the Specification, the Examiner had a reasonable basis for belief that Kais\\u2019 switch element would have a similar hardness to that of the prior art switch element described in the instant Specification (see Ans. 3, 5-6).  Thus, the claimed property (i.e., a hardness between 170 and 230 HB) would have reasonably been believed to have been an inherent characteristic of Kais\\u2019 switch element.  See In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255 (CCPA 1977) (\\u201cWhether the rejection is based on \\u2018inherency\\u2019 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102, on \\u2018prima facie obviousness\\u2019 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103, jointly or alternatively, the burden of proof is the same, and its fairness is evidenced by the PTO\\u2019s inability to manufacture products or to obtain and compare prior art products\\u201d).  Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 9 and claim 18, which falls with claim 9, as unpatentable over Kais, Bhadeshia, JP \\u2018342 and AAPA is sustained.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011244 Application 12/419,001  13 DECISION We AFFIRM the decision of the Examiner to reject claims 1-19.

DECISION ON APPEAL                                           1 Application filed March 6, 2006, which is a continuation of and claims benefit of U.S. Application No. 09/750,027, filed Dec. 29, 2000, which in turn claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/234,996, filed September 25, 2000.  The real party in interest is AOL, LLC. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006413 Application 11/276,586  2  STATEMENT OF THE CASE  Appellants seek our review under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 of the Examiner\\u2019s final decision rejecting claims 1-5, 9-14, and 21-29.  Claims 6-8 and 15-20 have been canceled (App. Br. 1.)2  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We affirm. Appellants\\u2019 Invention  The invention at issue on appeal concerns systems, machine-readable media, and methods for providing (making available) electronic information to a requestor based on previous request for related \\u201cnon-electronic\\u201d information.  (Spec. 1:9-10; 1:21-2:24; 3:24-4:17; Abstract.)   Representative Claim  Independent claim 1, reproduced below, with disputed limitations italicized, further illustrates the invention: 1.   A method for making electronic information more     readily available to one or more access requestors, the method comprising: identifying for transport electronic information stored at a data source; transporting the identified electronic information from the data source to a requesting access requestor; anticipating, using a processor, a demand of the access requestors for access to the electronic information based at least on past requests for access to related non-electronic                                            2 We refer to Appellants\\u2019 Specification (\\u201cSpec.\\u201d); Appeal Brief (\\u201cApp. Br.\\u201d) filed September 30, 2010; and Reply Brief (\\u201cReply Br.\\u201d) filed February 16, 2011.  We also refer to the Examiner\\u2019s Answer (\\u201cAns.\\u201d) mailed December 17, 2010. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006413 Application 11/276,586  3  information that is related to the electronic information, that is not particular to any single access requestor, and that is different from the electronic information; determining, based on the anticipated demand, to store the already identified and transported electronic information on a storage medium that is more accessible to the access requestors than the data source; and storing the transported electronic information on the storage medium. Rejection on Appeal The Examiner rejects claims 1-5, 9-14, and 21-29 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over U.S. Patent. No. 6,324,182 B1, issued Nov. 27, 2001 (filed Mar. 11, 1999) (\\u201cBurns\\u201d), U.S. Patent. No. 6,622,168 B1, issued Sep.16, 2003 (filed Nov. 24, 2000 claiming benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/195,806, filed on Apr. 10, 2000) (\\u201cDatta\\u201d), and U.S. Patent. No. 6,578,068 B1, issued Jun. 10, 2003 (filed Aug. 31, 1999) (\\u201cBowman-Amuah\\u201d).  ISSUE Based on our review of the administrative record, Appellants\\u2019 contentions, and the Examiner\\u2019s findings and conclusions, the pivotal issue before us follows:  Does the Examiner err in concluding that the combination of Burns, Datta, and Bowman-Amuah collectively teach or would have suggested \\u201canticipating, using a processor, a demand of the access requestors for access to the electronic information based at least on past requests for access to related non-electronic information that is related to the electronic information, that is not particular to any single access requestor, and that is \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006413 Application 11/276,586  4  different from the electronic information\\u201d within the meaning of claim 1 and the commensurate limitations of claims 28 and 29?  FINDINGS OF FACT We adopt the Examiner\\u2019s findings in the Answer and the Final Office Action mailed January 25, 2010 as our own, except as to those findings that we expressly overturn or set aside in the Analysis that follows.  ANALYSIS Based on Appellants\\u2019 arguments (App. Br. 3-5), we select independent claim 1 as representative of Appellants\\u2019 arguments and groupings with respect to claims 1-5, 9-14, and 21-29.  37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii)(2004).    Appellants contend that Burns, Datta, and Bowman-Amuah do not teach or suggest the disputed features recited in claim 1.  (App. Br. 3-5; Reply Br. 1-7.)  Specifically, Appellants contend that \\u201c[a]lthough the Bums system schedules delivery of web pages based on patterns of requests to the web pages, the Burns system does not schedule delivery of web pages based on past requests for access to non-electronic information.\\u201d  (App. Br. 3.)  Appellants also contend that \\u201c[a]lthough Datta describes a preloader that manages a cache of web page components, the Datta preloader does not manage the cache of web page components based on past requests for access to non-electronic information\\u201d  (App. Br. 4.)   Appellants further contend that Bowman-Amuah also does not describe anticipating access based on past requests for access to non-electronic information, but instead describes:  a system [ ] for distributing incoming requests from a user \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006413 Application 11/276,586  5  interface amongst a client and server components for optimizing usage of resources, where incoming requests are first received and stored by an activity module, then the activity module instructs a client to handle a first subset of the requests and passes a second subset of the requests on to a \\u201cutilization-based load balancer.\\u201d (App. Br. 4.) The Examiner sets forth a detailed explanation of the obviousness rejection in the Examiner\\u2019s Answer with respect to each of the claims (Ans. 3-14), and in particular claim 1 (Ans. 3-6, 12-14).  Specifically, the Examiner provides an interpretation of \\u201cnon-electronic information\\u201d (Ans. 13) and provides a detailed explanation with respect to Burns\\u2019 disclosure of scheduling frequently requested content based on, inter alia, the time of day and Bowman-Amuah\\u2019s disclosure of delivering request based on utilization and routing requests through an activity module.  (Ans. 3-6, 12-14 (citing Burns, col. 8, ll. 41-59; col. 9, ll. 12-34; Figs. 2, 3, 6 and Bowman-Amuah, col. 2, ll. 18-33; Abstract).)  From these findings, the Examiner concludes that Burns, Datta, and Bowman-Amuah render Appellants\\u2019 claim 1 obvious.  (Ans. 3-6, 12-14.)  We adopt these findings and this reasoning as our own.   Upon consideration of the evidence on this record and each of Appellants\\u2019 contentions, we find that the preponderance of evidence on this record supports the Examiner\\u2019s findings and ultimate conclusion that Burns, Datta, and Bowman-Amuah teach or would have at least suggested the disputed features of claim 1.  Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1 for the reasons set forth in the Answer, which we incorporate herein by reference.  (Ans. 3-6, 12-14.)  Our additional analysis will be limited to the following points of emphasis.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006413 Application 11/276,586  6  We initially note that the argued limitations fail to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art either structurally or functionally.  Specifically, the recited features argued by Appellants \\u2013 \\u201canticipating . . . a demand of the access requestors for access to the electronic information based at least on past requests for access to related non-electronic information that is related to the electronic information, that is not particular to any single access requestor, and that is different from the electronic information\\u201d (claim 1, emphasis added) \\u2013 essentially consist of non-functional descriptive material \\u2013 i.e., data.  Appellants merely attempt to distinguish the claim by the content of the \\u201cnon-electronic information\\u201d \\u2013 i.e., the data utilized by the unclaimed process/algorithm to \\u201canticipate\\u201d (predict) demand.   However, the content of the \\u201cnon-electronic information\\u201d does not change the functionality of the claimed process (method).  The recited functionality of the claim limitation \\u2013 \\u201canticipating\\u201d demand remains the same regardless of what the data constitutes, how the data may be named, or the relationship among the data and do not further limit the claimed invention either functionally or structurally.   The informational content of the data thus represents non-functional descriptive material, which \\u201cdoes not lend patentability to an otherwise unpatentable computer-implemented product or process.\\u201d  Ex parte Nehls, 88 USPQ2d 1883, 1889 (BPAI 2008) (precedential).  See Ex parte Curry, 84 USPQ2d 1272, 1274 (BPAI 2005) (informative) (Fed. Cir. Appeal No. 2006-1003), aff\\u2019d, (Rule 36) (June 12, 2006) (\\u201cwellness-related\\u201d data in databases and communicated on distributed network did not functionally change either the data storage system or the communication system used in the claimed method).  See also In re Ngai, 367 F.3d 1336, 1339 (Fed. Cir. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006413 Application 11/276,586  7  2004); Nehls, 88 USPQ2d at 1887-90 (discussing non-functional descriptive material). Even if we arguendo ascribe some patentable weight to the limitation, as explained by the Examiner (Ans. 13), \\u201cthe claimed \\u2018non-electronic information\\u2019 is broadly recited, and is not limited by the claim language or explained in Appellants\\u2019 specification regarding any specific mechanics.  At best, the claimed \\u2018non-electronic information\\u2019 . . . is interpreted as any \\u2018electronic information\\u2019 other than Appellant\\u2019s claimed \\u2018electronic information.\\u2019\\u201d  Appellants do not explicitly define \\u201cnon-electronic information\\u201d either in their Specification or the claim.  After a thorough review of Appellants\\u2019 Specification, we agree with the Examiner\\u2019s interpretation of \\u201cnon-electronic information\\u201d as being data that is related to but different from the \\u201celectronic information\\u201d which is the object of the anticipated demand.  This broad but reasonable construction is consistent with Appellants\\u2019 Specification (Spec. 3:24-4:17), which describes such information as being feedback from requestors, survey research, topics of interest, hobbies, etc.  We further note that any data/information utilized by a processor must be electronic information in its final processed form.   Even if we narrowly interpret, which we do not, the disputed \\u201cnon-electronic information\\u201d as originating in non-electronic form (non-electronic data), such as user input or feedback, both Burns and Bowman-Amuah describe such data.  Burns determines usage patterns (anticipates demand) based on the time of day and operator input (Burns, col. 8, ll. 53-59; col. 9, ll. 12-34).  Bowman-Amuah describes servicing information requests utilizing non-electronic criteria \\u2013 routing through an activity module to a \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006413 Application 11/276,586  8  load balancer based on server utilization.  (Bowman-Amuah, col. 2, ll. 18-24). Thus, Appellants do not persuade us of error in the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection of representative independent claim 1, independent claims 28 and 29, and dependent claims 2-5, 9-14, and 21-27 (dependent on claim 1), not separately argued with particularity.  (App. Br. 3-5.)  Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejections of claims 1-5, 9-14, and 21-29.  CONCLUSION OF LAW Appellants have not shown that the Examiner erred in rejecting claims 1-5, 9-14, and 21-29 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a).  DECISION We affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejections of claims 1-5, 9-14, and 21-29.  No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iv).  AFFIRMED   Vsh  \\x0c'},\n",

A testing method of a semiconductor device in which a plurality of\\nsemiconductor element areas are formed on a semiconductor substrate by\\nforming a plurality of unit exposed and printed areas including a first unit\\nexposed and printed area and a second unit exposed and printed area each of\\nwhich contains the semiconductor element areas, the testing method\\ncomprising:\\n\\nsimultaneously contacting a plurality of probes with the\\nsemiconductor elements located at corresponding positions in the first\\nexposed and printed area and the second unit exposed and printed area,\\nrespectively; and\\n\\nsimultaneously testing the semiconductor elements located at the\\ncorresponding positions in the first unit exposed and printed area and the\\nsecond unit exposed and printed area.\\n\\nThe Examiner relies upon the following references in the rejection of\\nthe appealed claims:\\n\\nFu 6,713,843 Mar. 20, 2004\\nPotts 6,844,218 B2 Jan. 18, 2005\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 claimed invention is directed to a method of\\nmanufacturing a semiconductor device (claim 1), and a testing method of a\\n\\nsemiconductor device (claim 3). The manufacturing method of claim 1 doesAppeal 2011-005455\\nApplication 12/153,481\\n\\nnot require any testing method, and, on the other hand, the testing method\\ndoes not recite any widths for first and second scribe lines.\\n\\nAppealed claims 3 and 4 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7l 02(e) as\\nbeing anticipated by Potts. Claims 1 and 2 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.\\n\\xa7 l03(a) as being unpatentable over Potts in View of Fu.\\n\\nAppellants do not provide separate arguments for claims 2 and 4,\\nwhich, therefore, stand or fall together with the claims upon which they\\ndepend.\\n\\nWe have thoroughly reviewed each of Appellants\\u2019 arguments for\\npatentability. However, we are in complete agreement with the Examiner\\nthat the claimed subject matter is unpatentable over the cited prior art.\\nAccordingly, we will sustain the Exa1niner\\'s rejections for the reasons set\\nforth in the Answer, which we incorporate herein, and we add the following\\nfor emphasis only.\\n\\nWe consider \\ufb01rst the Examiner\\'s \\xa7 102 rejection of claims 3 and 4.\\nAppellants maintain that Potts does not disclose contacting a plurality of\\nprobes with semiconductor elements located at corresponding positions in\\nthe \\ufb01rst and second exposed and printed areas. Appellants argue that \"Potts\\nin [sic, is] only teaching that individual die 32 within a single \"shot\" are\\ntested simultaneously\" (Br. 6, second para.). However, as pointed out by the\\nExaminer, Appellants\\u2018 argument is based upon the erroneous presumption\\nthat clai111 3 on appeal requires the \\ufb01rst and second exposed and printed\\nareas to be in separate, different \"shots.\" We agree with the Examiner that\\n\"each die area 321.4 [of Potts] can be considered a separate exposed and\\n\\nprinted area with a corresponding plurality of probe areas CP used to test theAppeal 2011-005455\\nApplication 12/153,481\\n\\nsemiconductor elements of each area\" (Ans. 6, first para.). For example, die\\narea 321 and die area 323 of Potts can be reasonably considered to\\ncorrespond to Appellants\\u2018 first unit exposed and printed area and second unit\\nexposed and printed area, respectively. Appellants do not dispute the\\nExaminer\\'s factual \\ufb01nding that Potts describes within the meaning of \\xa7 I02,\\nsi111ultaneously testing semiconductor elements via the probe points CP of\\neach of the exposed and printed areas 321-324 , citing Potts at column 11.\\nlines 11-16, and column 12, lines 17-21 and 43-45.\\n\\nTurning to the \\xa7 103 rejection of claims 1 and 2, Appellants contend\\nthat \"the combined device of Potts and Fu could not provide for scribe lines\\nfree of interconnections between the die 321-324 of Potts, because doing so\\nwould prohibit the formation of the connection lines and testing pads\\nrequired by Potts to occur between die 321-324 within a single shot Sl-l\" (Br.\\n10, penultimate para). However, as depicted in the Examiner\\'s annotated\\nFigure 2 of Potts, \"the \\ufb01rst and second exposed and printed areas would be\\nin different the [sic] shot areas having scribe lines inside and outside the shot\\narea, respectively\" (Ans. 6, second para).

SAINDON, SCOTT A. DANIELS, and JILL D. HILL, Administrative Patent Judges.  HILL, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012291 Application 11/602,675  2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE Robin Willats et al. (Appellants) appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 from a final rejection of claims 1-18.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We REVERSE.  CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER The claimed subject matter relates to \\u201ca control for an exhaust valve assembly that allows an exhaust valve to be rapidly and quietly closed as needed for vehicles including cylinder deactivation technology.\\u201d  Spec., para. [0001].  Claim 1 illustrates the subject matter on appeal and is reproduced below. 1.  A method for controlling an exhaust valve assembly comprising: (a) providing a flapper valve supported on a valve shaft for rotation within an exhaust component housing between an open position, an intermediate position, and a closed position; (b) moving the flapper valve to the intermediate position for a low engine speed condition; and (c) moving the flapper valve from the intermediate position to the closed position in response to a cylinder deactivation signal. EVIDENCE The Examiner relies on the following evidence:  Atkin US 4,707,987   Nov. 24, 1987 Hayashi US 4,875,336   Oct. 24, 1989 Nohl US 2005/0109024 A1  May 26, 2005 Lavin US 2005/0257517 A1  Nov. 24, 2005  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012291 Application 11/602,675  3 REJECTION Claims 1-4, 15, and 17 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Nohl and Lavin.  Ans. 3. Claims 5-11, 13, 14, 16, and 18 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Nohl, Lavin, and Atkin.  Ans. 6.1 ANALYSIS The Examiner finds that Nohl discloses a method for controlling an exhaust valve assembly 11 comprising:  providing a flapper valve 24 supported on a valve shaft 23 for rotation within an exhaust component housing 10 between an open position, an intermediate position, and a closed position.  Ans. 3 (citing Nohl, para. [0018]). The Examiner additionally finds that Lavin discloses moving the flapper valve to the intermediate position for a low engine speed condition, and moving the flapper valve from the intermediate position to the closed position in response to a cylinder deactivation signal, because Lavin discloses moving an exhaust flapper valve 46, 48 from an intermediate position (low restriction) to a closed position (high restriction) in response to cylinder deactivation.  Ans. 4 (citing Lavin, para. [0020]). Claims 1-4, 15, and 17 as Unpatentable over Nohl and Lavin Appellants argue that Nohl does not teach rotation of its valve 24 between three discrete positions\\u2014the claimed open, intermediate, and closed positions.  App. Br. 3.  In response to the Examiner\\u2019s assertion that partially blocking Nohl\\u2019s exhaust valve teaches a closed and an intermediate                                            1 Claim 12 stands \\u201cobjected to as allowable if [rewritten] in independent form.\\u201d  Ans. 2. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012291 Application 11/602,675  4 position (Ans. 15), Appellants argue that Nohl refers to the partially blocked positions as the closed position, even though the exhaust is not entirely closed.  App. Br. 4.  Whether or not the blockage creates a closed position or an intermediate position, Nohl does not, even considering the blockage, teach three distinct positions to which the valve can be rotated. Regarding Lavin, Appellants argue that it provides no teaching of moving from an intermediate position to a closed position in response to a cylinder deactivation signal, and instead discloses moving the valves from the position shown in Figure 2 (upper valve closed and lower valve opened) when the engine is in a high output mode to the position shown in Figure 3 (upper valve opened and lower valve closed) when the engine is in a low output mode.  App. Br. 4-5.  Appellants assert that, because neither Nohl nor Lavin discloses the claimed three distinct positions for the valve, including an intermediate position, the Examiner has not established prima facie obviousness.  App. Br. 5. In response, the Examiner contends that movement of a valve between open and closed positions \\u201cobviously includes an intermediate position as this is in between the closed and open position.\\u201d  Ans. 15.  Even though movement of the valve between opened and closed positions includes passage through intermediate positions, claim 1 recites movement of the valve from the intermediate position to the closed position in response to a cylinder deactivation signal, and Nohl does not teach an intermediate position from which movement of the flapper is controlled to a closed position.   The Examiner notes that Nohl\\u2019s paragraph [0018] teaches that valve 24 moves between open and closed positions, and that the amount of \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012291 Application 11/602,675  5 movement of the valve is tailored to the desired sound, which the Examiner finds to mean that there are intermediate positions of the valve, as opposed to two positions\\u2014open and closed.  Id.  The Examiner further finds that Nohl\\u2019s paragraph [0019] teaches partially blocking the exhaust with the valve to attain an intermediate position that creates a desired sound.  Id.   In the Reply Brief, Appellants disagree with the Examiner\\u2019s reasoning, arguing that Nohl\\u2019s reference to tailoring a blockage refers to tailoring a blockage for the valve\\u2019s closed position, and therefore, Nohl\\u2019s blockage does not teach an intermediate position.  Reply Br. 3.   We understand that an open position for the exhaust valve assembly includes the valve being orientated generally parallel to, or at a slight angle relative to, an axis defined by the direction of exhaust flow, a closed position for the exhaust valve assembly includes the valve being orientated generally perpendicular to an axis defined by a direction of exhaust flow, and an intermediate position for the exhaust valve assembly is defined by a position therebetween.  Spec., para. [0007].   Because the valve in Nohl has only two positions, we agree with Appellants that the reference fails to teach the claimed valve that is moved between three distinct positions\\u2014open, intermediate, and closed\\u2014based on an aspect of engine performance.  Whether the position referred to in Nohl is considered to be a closed position or an intermediate position, it is still a single position and thus Nohl cannot move its valve from an intermediate portion to a closed position, the positions being one and the same.  Lavin does not cure this deficiency of Nohl.  For the reasons set forth above, we do not sustain the rejection of claim 1.  Claims 2-4, 15, and 17 depend directly or indirectly from claim 1, \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012291 Application 11/602,675  6 and we therefore do not sustain the rejections of claims 2-4, 15, and 17 for the same reason. Claims 5-11, 13, 14, 16, 18 as Unpatentable over Nohl, Lavin, and Atkin Claim 7 recites a valve being moveable between a closed position, an intermediate position, and an open position, an actuator to actively move the valve between the closed, intermediate, and open positions, and a controller generating a control signal to move the valve from the intermediate position to the closed position when a cylinder has been deactivated. Appellants argue that the rejection of claim 7 is improper for the same reason that the rejection of claim 1 was improper, and that Atkin does not cure the deficiencies of Nohl and Lavin.  App. Br. 9.  We agree with Appellants for the reasons set forth above.  The Examiner does not find that Atkin cures the deficiencies of Nohl and Lavin.  Thus, for the reasons set forth above with respect to claim 1, we do not sustain the rejection of claim 7. Claims 5, 6, and 16 depend directly or indirectly from claim 1.  We therefore do not sustain the rejection of claims 5, 6, and 16. Claim 8-11, 13, 14, and 18 depend directly or indirectly from claim 7.  We therefore do not sustain the rejections of claims 8-11, 13, 14, and 18.    DECISION We REVERSE the rejection of claims 1-4, 15, and 17 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Nohl and Lavin.  We REVERSE the rejection of claims 5-11, 13, 14, 16, and 18 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Nohl, Lavin, and Atkin.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012291 Application 11/602,675  7 REVERSED        msc \\x0c'},\n",

CRAWFORD, JOSEPH A. FISCHETTI, and BIBHU R. MOHANTY, Administrative Patent Judges.  CRAWFORD, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-009934 Application 11/323,792    2STATEMENT OF THE CASE Appellants seek our review under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 of the Examiner\\u2019s final decision rejecting claims 10 to 26.  We have jurisdiction over the appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We AFFIRM. BACKGROUND  Appellants\\u2019 invention is directed to a system and method for applying seller and item filters in a network-based transaction facility.  Claim 10 is illustrative:  10.   A system comprising: a processor configured to apply a qualification filter to one or more items listed on a network based transaction facility to identify one or more qualified items, and to place the qualified items on a network based elite transaction facility such that the network based elite transaction facility comprises a subset of qualified items identified by the qualification filter.   The Examiner relies on the following prior art references as evidence of unpatentability:  Skorski   U.S. 2004/0012631 A1   Jan. 22, 2004 Albazz   U.S. 7,620,570 B2    Nov. 17, 2009 Wiseman   U.S. 7,725,477 B2    May 25, 2010  Auctionmapper\\u2122 \\u2013 It\\u2019s like radar for eBAY auctions.

Claims 10, 11, 15 to 18, and 22 to 25 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as anticipated by Wiseman. Claims 10 to 26 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as anticipated by Albazz. Claim 26 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as anticipated by BidXs. Claim 26 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as being anticipated by Skorski.  ISSUES  Did the Examiner err in rejecting the claims 10 to 12, 17 to 19, and 24 to 26 as anticipated by Auctionmapper because Auctionmapper does not disclose an elite transaction facility?  Did the Examiner err in rejecting claims 10, 11, 15 to 18, and 22 to 25 as anticipated by Wiseman because Wiseman does not disclose filtering items from one transaction facility and placing those items on another transaction facility?  Did the Examiner err in rejecting claims 10 to 26 as anticipated by Albazz because Albazz does not disclose an elite transaction facility?  Did the Examiner err in rejecting claim 26 as anticipated by BidXs because BidXs does not disclose a subset of qualified items or a separate elite transaction facility?  Did the Examiner err in rejecting claim 26 as anticipated by Skorski because Skorski does not disclose an elite transaction facility or first and second domain address?  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-009934 Application 11/323,792    4FACTUAL FINDINGS We adopt the Examiner\\u2019s findings regarding the teachings of Auctionmapper, Wiseman, BidXs, and Skorski as our own.  Ans. 5 to 15 and 22 to 25.  Additional findings of fact appear in the Analysis that follows.   ANALYSIS Anticipation by Auctionmapper  We are not persuaded of error on the part of the Examiner by Appellants\\u2019 argument that Auctionmapper does not disclose an elite transaction facility because an elite transaction facility requires that the sellers have been filtered, and Auctionmapper does not filter sellers.  We find that Auctionmapper discloses on page 1: (1) a box that may be selected for sellers that only accept paypal, (2) a box that may be selected so that only sellers that offer paypal buyer protection plans are shown, and (3) a box to select the distance the seller is from the buyer.  In our view, this disclosure in Auctionmapper is a disclosure of filtering sellers.  In view of the foregoing, we will sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 10.  We will also sustain the rejection as it is directed to claims 11, 12, 17 to 19, and 24 to 26 because the Appellants have not argued the separate patentability of these claims.   Anticipation by Wiseman  We are not persuaded of error on the part of the Examiner by Appellants\\u2019 argument that Wiseman does not disclose filtering items from one transaction facility and placing those items on another transaction facility.  We agree with and adopt as our own the Examiner\\u2019s findings in \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-009934 Application 11/323,792    5regard to this rejection at pages 11 to 12 and the Examiner\\u2019s response to Appellants\\u2019 rejection at pages 33 to 36.  In particular, we agree with the Examiner that as Wiseman discloses that a user can filter sellers so that only qualified sellers are displayed on the new filtered page, Wiseman does disclose placing items on another transaction facility.  In view of the foregoing, we will sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 10.  We will also sustain this rejection as it is directed to claims 11 and 15 to 18, 22 and 23 because the Appellants have not argued the separate patentability of these claims.    We will also sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 24 and 25 as anticipated by Wiseman because we are not persuaded of error on the part of the Examiner by Appellants\\u2019 argument that Wiseman does not disclose applying a qualification filter to one or more sellers.  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s finding on page  6 of the Answer, that the disclosure at column 2, lines 6 to 17 of filtering of sellers such that only trusted sellers and sellers in a social group are shown  is a disclosure of applying a qualification filter to one or more sellers.   Anticipation by Albazz  We will not sustain the anticipation rejection based on the Albazz reference because we agree with the Appellants that Albazz does not disclose an elite transaction facility.    Appellants\\u2019 Specification discloses that within a network-based facility for sellers to list items for sale, filters are used to select a subset of sellers and their items for participation in an elite transaction facility.  A process is performed to apply filters to identify a group of sellers (para. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-009934 Application 11/323,792    6[0024]).  As such, we find that an elite transaction facility within the meaning of the present application includes filters so that a subset of sellers can be selected.  The Examiner finds that Albazz discloses the elite transaction facility at column 9, lines 57 to 68; column 10, lines 1 to 15, and lines 62 to 66; and column 11, lines 19 to 34 (Ans. 36).  However, we find that these portions of Albazz disclose filtering buyers by sellers and filtering products and conditions of sale by buyers, but there is no disclosure of an elite transaction facility having filtered sellers.  In view of the foregoing, we will not sustain the rejection of claim 10 and claims 11 to 16 dependent thereon as anticipated by Albazz.  We will also not sustain the rejection as it is directed to claims 17 to 26 because each of these claims requires an elite transaction facility.   Anticipation by BidXs  We are not persuaded of error on the part of the Examiner by Appellants\\u2019 argument that BidXs does not disclose a separate network based elite transaction facility.  We initially note that claim 26 does not require a separate elite transaction facility but rather claim 26 recites a network based elite transaction facility comprising a first domain and a network based elite transaction facility, which comprises a second domain.  We agree with the Examiner and find that the disclosure depicted in Figure on page 2 and on page 38 of the Answer discloses that sellers on a first site are filtered based on whether they sell their products on Amazon, eBay, or Yahoo Auctions.  As such, BidXs discloses an elite transaction facility.  We also agree that the disclosure in BidXs that the user leaves one site to purchase on another site \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-009934 Application 11/323,792    7such as Amazon, eBay, or Yahoo, BidXs discloses one network facility on one domain and another elite network transaction facility on another domain.  In view of the foregoing, we will sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 26.  Anticipation by Skorski  We will not sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 26 as anticipated by Skorski because we agree with the Appellants that Skorski does not disclose a network based elite transaction facility.  We find that Skorski discloses that products are filtered according to different populations of users and that different retailers could have their catalogs hosted on the same server (paras [0009]; [0017]).  However, there is no disclosure of filtering sellers to form an elite transaction facility.  DECISION We affirm the following rejections:   Claims 10 to 12, 17 to 19, and 24 to 26 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(a) as anticipated by Auctionmapper. Claims 10, 11, 15 to 18, and 22 to 25 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as anticipated by Wiseman. Claim 26 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as anticipated by BidXs. We reverse the following rejections:  Claims 10 to 26 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as anticipated by Albazz. Claim 26 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as being anticipated by Skorski.     \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-009934 Application 11/323,792    8No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a).

DECISION ON APPEAL   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004844 Application 11/040,270     2STATEMENT OF THE CASE  Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from a final rejection of claims 1-7, 9, and 11-19.  Claims 8 and 10 were cancelled during prosecution.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We affirm. INVENTION  This invention relates to \"the field of collaborative computing and more particularly to a unified view of tasks from heterogeneous task lists.\"  (Spec. 1).  Claim 1, reproduced below, is representative of the claimed subject matter: 1.  A collaborative system for presenting a unified view of tasks from heterogeneous task management sources, the system comprising:  a processor with memory;  a task weaver comprising program code executable by the process in the memory and coupled to a plurality of heterogeneous task management sources;  a unified task database; and,   a task weaver user interface coupled to said task weaver and rendering during execution in the memory a hierarchal arrangement of unified task icons representing underlying tasks in said unified task database, each task in the hierarchy being characterized by a position in the hierarchy,  [L]  the position comprising an indication of whether a corresponding one of the tasks is [L1] prerequisite to completing a subsequent one of the tasks, or [L2] prerequisite to blocking completion of a subsequent one of the tasks.  (Disputed limitations emphasized, elements lettered).   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004844 Application 11/040,270     3REJECTION The Examiner rejected claims 1-7, 9, and 11-19 under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 102(b) as anticipated by Nwana (U.S. Patent No. 6,266,805).  RELATED PRIOR DECISION    Appeal No. 2009-008610 (Application No. 11/040,270), BPAI Decision mailed April 19, 2011.  (Examiner Affirmed).   GROUPING OF CLAIMS  Based on Appellants\\' arguments, we decide the appeal of the anticipation rejection of claims 1-7, 9, and 11-19 on the basis of representative claim 1.  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(iv)(2012). 1  ANALYSIS  We disagree with Appellants\\u2019 contentions regarding the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of the claims.  We adopt as our own: (1) the findings and reasons set forth by the Examiner in the action from which this appeal is taken, and (2) the reasons set forth by the Examiner in the Answer in response to arguments made in Appellants\\u2019 Appeal Brief.  (Ans. 2-3).  We highlight and address specific findings and arguments below.                                                           1 Appellants filed a Notice of Appeal on July 10, 2012.  The date of filing the Notice of Appeal determines which set of rules applies to an Ex Parte appeal.  If a notice of appeal is filed on or after January 23, 2012, then the 2012 version of the Board Rules (Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations (37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.1 et seq.)) published on November 22, 2011 in the Federal Register notice applies to the appeal.     \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004844 Application 11/040,270     4A.  Issue: Under \\xa7102, did the Examiner err in finding Nwana discloses \"[L] the position comprising an indication of whether a corresponding one of the tasks is [L1] prerequisite to completing a subsequent one of the tasks, or [L2] prerequisite to blocking completion of a subsequent one of the tasks,\" (emphasis added), within the meaning of claim 1 and the commensurate language of claim 9?   As an initial matter of claim construction, we conclude limitation L is disclosed by a reference that discloses either L1 or L2, as these limitations are expressly recited in the alternative using \\u201cor\\u201d language.  (Claim 1).    Specifically, limitation L only requires \"the position comprising an indication of whether a corresponding one of the tasks is\"  (L1) \"prerequisite to completing a subsequent one of the tasks,\" or  (L2) \"prerequisite to blocking completion of a subsequent one of the tasks.\"  Therefore, limitation L of claim 1 is met by a reference that discloses either L1 or L2. 1. Limitation L1  Appellants contend \"nothing in Figure 13 provides that any one task is a prerequisite for completing or blocking a subsequent task.\"  (App. Br. 7).    Appellants\\' contention is unpersuasive.  The Examiner finds, and we agree, that limitation L1 is disclosed by Nwana\\'s Gannt chart Figure 13 where the position of Task icon 1315 and its associated arrow (make printer cartridge) that indicates Task 1315 (make cartridge) \"is a prerequisite to completing a subsequent one of the tasks\" (Task 1316, make printer).  (Ans. 3; Nwana col. 37, l. 65 \\u2013 col. 38, l. 13 (Task 1316 is waiting on Task 1315); \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004844 Application 11/040,270     5also see Nwana\\'s Figs. 7 and 8; Final Rej. 4, 8-9 (dated April 10, 2012)).  Appellants fail to rebut the Examiner\\'s findings.    As discussed above, because Nwana discloses limitation L1, we find Nwana discloses the limitation at issue L which requires either L1 or L2.   Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner rejection of claim 1, and of claims 2-7, 9, and 11-19, which fall therewith.   2. Limitation L2  Assuming arguendo that our reviewing court could disagree with our finding regarding limitation L1, we note again that L1 and L2 are claimed in the alternative using \\u201cor\\u201d language. (Claim 1).  As discussed above, the Examiner need only show that either L1 or L2 is described in Nwana to establish anticipation.  In the interest of completeness, we reach the merits of limitation L2.  Regarding limitations L, L1, and L2 of claim 1, the Examiner concludes: [A] broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim in view of the specification provides that when a task is indicated as prerequisite to completing a subsequent task, not completing this prerequisite task will block completion of a subsequent task as the subsequent task no longer has all its prerequisites to completion met.  (Ans. 3).  The Examiner also finds, and we agree, that limitation L2 is disclosed by Nwana\\u2019s Task icon 1315 (Fig. 13) that is a prerequisite for blocking the completion of task 1315 because until Task 1315 is completed, subsequent Task 1316 is blocked.  (Ans. 3).  We conclude the Examiner\\'s broad but reasonable interpretation of L2 is consistent with Appellants\\u2019 description in \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004844 Application 11/040,270     6the Specification of an unfinished prerequisite task that is prerequisite to blocking a subsequent task.  (Spec. \\xb6[0021], \\xb6[0029]; Appellants\\' Fig. 3).  Appellants contend limitation L2 requires \"an indication of whether\"[the completion of] \"a corresponding one of the tasks is . . . [L2] prerequisite to blocking completion of a subsequent one of the tasks.\\u201d  (Reply Br. 4-6).  Appellants\\' contention is unpersuasive because Appellants\\' contention is not commensurate with the broader scope of the claim.  Specifically, limitation L does not recite the completion of \"a corresponding one of the tasks . . . .\"  (Claim 1).   For these reasons, on this record, we are not persuaded of Examiner error.      DECISION  We affirm the Examiner\\'s rejection of claims 1-7, 9, and 11-19 under \\xa7 102.   No time for taking any action connected with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1).     AFFIRMED  Vsh \\x0c'},\n",

A material for repairing a local defect in a dwelling\\n\\ufb01nish surface having a \\ufb01rst color, the material\\ncomprising a compound that hardens upon curing and a\\npigment component mixed with the compound to give\\nthe mixture a second color that, when placed over the\\nlocal defect, is readily distinguished by the unaided\\nhuman eye from the adjacent first color at least after the\\nmixture has cured.\\n\\n6. A method of repairing a local defect in a dwelling\\n\\ufb01nish surface having a \\ufb01rst color, the method\\ncomprising:\\n\\n(a) mixing a compound that hardens upon curing with a\\npigment component, thereby giving the compound a\\nsecond color that is readily distinguished by the\\nunaided human eye fro111 the \\ufb01rst color at least after\\nthe compound has cured;\\n\\n(by) spreading the mixture on the surface at the location\\nof the local defect, thereby covering the local defect\\nand leaving at least some of the dwelling \\ufb01nish\\nsurface exposed for visual comparison to the second\\ncolor;\\n\\n(c) waiting for the mixture to cure; and\\n(d) viewing the cured mixture and the surface and\\n\\ndistinguishing the visible second color of the mixture\\nfrom the Visible, adjacent \\ufb01rst color of the surface.Appeal 2011-011945\\nApplication 1 1/ 589,443\\n\\nTHE PRIOR ART\\nThe Examiner relied upon the following as evidence of\\n\\nunpatentability:\\n\\nSchoonbeck US 4,406,107 Sep. 27, 1983\\nMcCampbell US 2006/0027145 A1 Feb. 9, 2006\\nFoster US 2006/0096074 A1 May 1 1, 2006\\n\\nTHE REJECTIONS\\nClaims 1-5 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a) as being\\nunpatentable over Foster and McCampbell.\\nClaims 6-9 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a) as being\\n\\nunpatentable over Schoonbeck and McCa111pbell.\\n\\nOPINION\\n\\nClaims 1-5 Obviousnesx\\nFoster and McCampbe//\\n\\nAmong the requirements of claim 1 is that the color of the repair\\nmaterial be \\u201creadily distinguished\\u201d from the color of the adjacent surface\\nbeing repaired. The Examiner found that Foster discloses a material for\\nrepairing a local defect in a dwelling surface of a first color, the mate\\ufb01al\\ncomprising a compound that hardens upon curing and having \\u201ca pigment\\ncomponent . . . mixed with the compound to give the mixture a second\\ncolor.\\u201d Ans. 5. The Examiner recognized that Foster fails to disclose that\\nthe second color \\u201cis readily distinguishable from the \\ufb01rst color when placed\\nover the local defect.\" Ans. 5. However, with regard to this shortcoming,\\nthe Examiner takes the position that McCan1pbell discloses \\u201cthat the second\\ncomponent has a coloring property to add a tint to the composition,\\u201d and\\n\\nconcludes that it \\u201cwould have been obvious . . . to have formed the materialAppeal 2011-011945\\n\\nApplication ll/589,443\\n\\nwitl1 a second color that is distinguishable from the color of the dwelling\\n\\ufb01nish surface in order to allow the viewer to locate the damage location.\\u201d\\nAns. 5-6.\\n\\nAppellant argues that \\u201c[n]othing in Foster teaches that the color of the\\nplaster material is distinguishable from the surrounding wall\\u201d (Appeal Br.\\n14\\u201c). and that McCa1npbell \\u201cteaches away from using a spackle color that\\ndiffers from the wall cover, because McCampbell teaches to cover the entire\\nwall with the colored material\" (Appeal Br. 15:). Thus, Appellant asserts, the\\nExaminer\\u2019s conclusion that these two references render the claimed\\ninvention obvious is the product of hindsight reasoning. Appeal Br. 14.\\n\\nFoster discloses a patch repair composition for use on wallboard and\\nplaster walls and ceilings. Para. [0008]. In one of the embodiments, the\\ncomposition comprises resin binder. pigment, water and \\ufb01bers. Para.\\n\\n[001 5]. However. while the addition of a pigment could add color to the\\npatch repair composition, there is no teaching in Foster regarding any\\nrelationship between the color of the patch repair composition and the color\\nof the surface upon which it is applied to effect a repair.\\n\\nMcCampbell is directed to an improvement in applying a paste or\\nplaster to a wall to create a textured coating. Para. [0002]. According to\\nMcCampbell, in the prior art this has been accomplished by first applying\\nthe coating and then painting it the desired color. Para. [0004].\\nMcCan1pbell goes on to explain that the prior art method is ti1ne\\u2014consuming\\nbecause it requires two steps, and because the paste or plaster typically is a\\nwhite or gray color, which becomes visible ifthe paint is later chipped or\\ngouged. Paras. [0005]\\u2014[0006]. To overcome these problems, McCampbell\\n\\nprovides a \\u201ctinted texturing mixture for application on a surface,\\u201d whichAppeal 2011-011945\\n\\nApplication ll/589,443\\n\\ncomprises a conventional joint compound with adherence properties that is\\nmixed with a substance having a coloring property. Para. [0008]. Then, if the\\ncoating of textured mixture is chipped or damaged, \\u201cthe color witl1in its\\ninterior provides a color consistent with the exterior surface of the mixture.\"\\nPara. [U017]. There is no teaching in McCampbell of using the disclosed\\ncolored textured material to repair a local defect in a \\ufb01nish surface, much\\nless that the repair material be of a color different than that of the surface\\nbeing repaired.\\n\\n\\u201c[R] ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere\\nconclusory statements; instead, there 111ust be some articulated reasoning\\nwith some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of\\nobviousness.\\u201d In re Kczlm, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In the\\npresent case, the Examiner\\u2019s rationale for combining the references, that is,\\nto make the repair readily distinguishable to the user, is not recognized in\\neither of the applied references, nor is there a teaching in either reference\\nregarding the use of two different colors for any purpose. It therefore is our\\nview that the references do not provide support for the Examiner\\u2019s\\nconclusion that they would have suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art\\nthat the material for repairing a defect in a surface having a \\ufb01rst color be of\\n\\u201ca second color that, when placed over the local defect, is readily\\ndistinguished by the unaided human eye from the adjacent \\ufb01rst color,\\u201d as is\\nrequired by claim 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the rejection of independent claim 1 and claims 2-5, which\\n\\ndepend from claim I, is not sustained.Appeal 2011-011945\\nApplication 1 1/ 589,443\\n\\nClaims 6-9 \\u2014 ()bvz\\'0usness\\nSchoonbeck and McCampbell\\n\\nlndependent clai111 6 is directed to a method for repairing a local\\ndefect in a dwelling finish surface having a first color, by utilizing a repair\\nmaterial of a readily distinguished second color. The Exa111iner\\u2019s position is\\nthat Schoonbeck discloses spreading a repair mixture over a local defect,\\nafter which the plaster or grout repair may be painted with a paint having a\\ncolor matching the remainder of the wall, \\u201cwhich implies that the material is\\na second color, different than the dwelling finish surface, but the disclosure\\ndoes not specifically disclose that the surface finish is a second color.\\u201d Ans.\\n7. With regard to that feature, the Examiner states \\u201cMcCampbell discloses\\nmixing a compound witl1 a pigment component (Paragraph [0008]) giving\\nthe compound a second color,\\u201d and concludes that it would have been\\nobvious to have formed the McCa111pbell compound \\u201cwith a second color\\nthat is distinguishable fro111 the color of the dwelling \\ufb01nish surface in order\\nto allow the viewer to locate the damaged location and f1nisl1 the damage\\nlocation with sand paper, paints, etc.\\u201d Ans. 8.\\n\\nAppellant argues that Schoonbeck \\u201cfails to teach that a plaster\\ncompound is a second color, distinguishable fro111 the wall\\u2019s color,\\u201d that in\\nMcCa1npbell the entire wall is covered, and that the Examiner has failed to\\ngive an approp\\ufb01ate reason to combine the references. Appeal Br. 17.\\n\\nSchoonbeck discloses a method for repairing walls wherein a hole is\\npatched with plaster or grout and is sanded to a smooth \\ufb01nish, after which\\n\\u201cthe plaster or grout . . . may be painted with a paint having a color matching\\nthe remainder of the wall.\" Col. 5, ll. 32-43. There is no teaching that the\\n\\nrepair material is of a color different than that of the finish surface beingAppeal 2011-011945\\nApplication ll/589,443\\nrepaired. As explained supra, McCampbell teaches tinting a textured wall\\ncoating so that color extends through its entire thickness, with no mention\\nbeing 111ade of repair or of contrasting colors. Therefore, on the basis of the\\nsame reasoning as with the rejection of claims 1-5, supra, Schoonbeck and\\nMcCan1pbell fail to provide support for the Exan1iner\\u2019s conclusion that their\\ncombined teachings would have suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art\\nthe claimed method of repairing a defect in a surface of a first color, which\\nincludes the step of \\u201cmixing a compound . . . with a pigment component,\\nthereby giving the compound a second color that is readily distinguished . . .\\nfrom the first color.\\u201d Ans. 8.\\n\\nThe rejection of independent claim 6 and dependent claims 7-9 is not\\n\\nsustained.\\n\\nDECISION\\nThe rejection of clai111s 1-5 as being unpatentable over Foster and\\nMcCampbell is reversed.\\nThe rejection of claims 6-9 stand rejected as being unpatentable over\\n\\nSchoonbeck and McCampbell is reversed.\\n\\nREVERSED\\n\\nrvb'},\n",

App. Br. 16-17.\\nThe Examiner responds that:\\n\\nby patterning the Cr layer to leave the Cr layer between the\\nphotodiodes, one is forming a trench ring around the \\ufb01lter and\\nlight sensor (and the patterning process is by etching), in a layer\\nof material deposited over the spectrometer and by default this\\nhas also formed a light barrier for blocking light.\\n\\nAns. 18 (emphasis added).\\n\\nWe disagree with the Examiner. The Examiner does not speci\\ufb01cally\\nstate, and it is not apparent, how patterning or etching a Cr layer from Hyun\\nwould result in Appellants\\u2019 clai111ed \\u201ctrench ring around the \\ufb01lter and light\\nsensor.\\u201d While the Cr layer as disclosed by Hyun could be patterned or\\netched, the patterning or etching would not necessarily result in Appellants\\u2019\\nclaimed \\u201ctrench ring around the \\ufb01lter and light sensor.\\u201d As such, we \\ufb01nd\\nthat the Examiner has not provided an adequate factual basis for supporting\\na prinzafacie case of obviousness of Appellants\\u2019 invention as recited in\\nindependent claim 17. See In re Warner, 379 F.2d 1011, 1017 (CCPA 1967)\\n(\\u201cA rejection based on section 103 clearly 111ust rest on a factual basis\\u201d).\\n\\nFor the reasons set forth above, Appellants have persuaded us of\\n\\nreversible error in the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of independent claim 17 and its\\n\\n10Appeal 2011-007538\\nApplication 1 1/81 1,692\\n\\ndependent claims 19. 20, and 29, which were not separately argued, under\\n35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a). Accordingly, we cannot sustain the Examiner\\u2019s\\nrejection of Appellants\\u2019 claims 17. 19. 20, and 29 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a)\\nas being unpatentable over Cole, Toyoda, and Hyun.\\n\\nWith respect to dependent claim 6, Appellants argue that the\\nExaminer has not established that Appellants\\u2019 claimed \\u201cbarrier comprises an\\nelectrically conductive ring that completely surrounds said \\ufb01lter and light\\nsensor\\u201d are disclosed by Cole, Toyoda, and Hyun. App. Br. 17.\\n\\nThe Examiner responds that Hyun is only relied upon to teach that the\\nbarrier could be made of a conductive material, noting that all materials are\\nconductive to some degree.

The fact that the barrier could be made of a conductive material\\ndoes not mean that Appellants\\u2019 clai111ed \\u201cbarrier\\u201d could comprise \\u201can\\nelectrically conductive ring that completely surrounds said \\ufb01lter and light\\nsensor,\\u201d as recited in claim 6.

App. Br. 9-13; Reply Br. 7-10.\\nIn particular, Appellants acknowledge Toyoda discloses a stop (6) that\\nprovides light through a series of apertures to an optical lens array (3) and\\nthen a photodetector array (4), and a light shielding block, i.e., \\u201cbarrier\\u201d (5)\\nthat has partitioning Walls (Sb) and circular apertures, i.e., \\u201copening\\u201d (5a) for\\npartitioning a space between the optical lens array (3) and the photodetector\\narray (4) to prevent lights emitted from respective optical lens (2) from\\ninterfering with each other. App. Br. 12; Reply Br. 8-9. Nevertheless,\\nAppellants argue that the \\u201cbarrier\\u201d (5) as disclosed by Toyoda is located\\nbelow the optical lens array (3) and does not include the clai111ed \\u201copening\\noptically coupled with said \\ufb01lter and con\\ufb01gured to admit light to said \\ufb01lter\\nat only a particular range of angles.\\u201d App. Br. 12; Reply Br. 8-9.\\nAppellants further argue that Toyoda does not disclose any form of color\\n\\ufb01lters and, as such, provides no reason for one skilled in the art to extend the\\nbarrier to completely surround the filters of Cole to arrive at Appellants\\u2019\\n\\nclaimed invention. App. Br. 13.Appeal 2011-007538\\nApplication 1 1/81 1,692\\n\\nWe are not persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 argument. Contrary to\\nAppellants\\u2019 contention, Toyoda is not cited for disclosing color \\ufb01lters,\\nwhich are already disclosed by Cole; rather, Toyoda is cited for disclosing\\nthe use of a light shielding block, i.e., \\u201cbarrier\\u201d (5) with partitions (Sb) to\\nprevent lights emitted from respective optical lens (2) from interfering with\\neach other, as correctly found by the Examiner. Ans. 5 (citing Toyoda,\\n\\ufb02l [0025], FIG. 1 and FIG. 2\\u201c). As recognized by Appellants, the light\\nshielding block, i.e., \\u201cbarrier\\u201d (5) of Toyoda is also provided with circular\\napertures, i.e., \\u201copening\\u201d (521) to admit ligl1t. As such, we \\ufb01nd that the\\nExaminer\\u2019s factual \\ufb01ndings regarding Cole and Toyoda are supported by a\\npreponderance of evidence.\\n\\nWhen the light-shielding block, i.e., \\u201cbarrier\\u201d (5) of Toyoda is\\nincorporated into the spectrophotometer of Cole in the manner suggested by\\nthe Examiner, \\u201cit [would also be] proper to take into account not only\\nspeci\\ufb01c teachings of the references but also the inferences which one skilled\\nin the art would reasonably be expected to draw therefrom.\\u201d In re Preda,\\n401 F.2d 825, 826 (CCPA 1968\\u201c). One of ordinary skill in the art looking at\\nCole and Toyoda would certainly draw the inference that, when the light\\nshielding block, i.e., \\u201cbarrier\\u201d (51) having an opening (Sad) to admit light as\\ndisclosed by Toyoda is incorporated into the spectrophotometer of Cole. the\\nopening (5a) of such a barrier (5) would be optically coupled with the \\ufb01lter\\nof Cole and would admit light to the \\ufb01lter at a particular range of angles, as\\nthe Examiner found. Ans. 11-12. As such, we \\ufb01nd the Examiner\\u2019s reason\\nfor combining Cole and Toyoda proper, i.e., to prevent cross contamination\\n\\nof stray light between detection areas or sensor arrays. Id. at 5-6, 10, 12-13Appeal 2011-007538\\nApplication 1 1/81 1,692\\n\\n(citing Toyoda, 11 [0025]). Consequently, we agree with the Exa1niner\\u2019s\\nconclusion that it would have been obvious to one skilled in the art to extend\\nthe barrier of Toyoda to surround the \\ufb01lter and light sensor of Cole with an\\nopening optically coupled to the \\ufb01lter in order to prevent light emitted from\\ninterfering with each other. Id. at 5-6.\\n\\nAppellants argue separately that the Examiner has impen11issibly used\\nhindsight bias. App. Br. 13-15; Reply Br. 9-11. We recognize, as correctly\\nnoted by the Examiner, that anyjudgment on obviousness is in a sense\\nnecessarily a reconstruction based upon hindsight reasoning. However, such\\nreasoning is permissible so long as it takes into account only knowledge\\nwhich was within the level of ordinary skill at the time the claimed invention\\nwas made and does not include knowledge gleaned only from applicant\\u2019s\\ndisclosure. Ans. 15 (citing In re McLaug/7/in, 443 F.2d 1392, 1395 (CCPA\\n1971)\\u201c). Moreover, Appellants do not meaningfully explain 11ow the\\nExaminer\\u2019s determination of obviousness is based only upon knowledge\\ngleaned fro111 the Appellants\\u2019 Speci\\ufb01cation. As discussed supra, Toyoda\\nprovides a reason for one skilled in the art to extend the barrier to\\ncompletely surround the filters of Cole to arrive at Appellants\\u2019 claimed\\ninvention. Ans. 5-6, 10, 12-13 (citing Toyoda, 11 [0025]).\\n\\nFor the reasons set forth above, Appellants have not persuaded us of\\nreversible error in the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of independent clai111 1 and its\\ndependent claims 2-5, 8, 16, and 21-23, which were not separately argued,\\nunder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103 (a).

(App. Br. 7-1 1). ln particular, Appellant argues that the prior art\\ndescribe or suggest a cigarette \\ufb01lter segment comprised of a \\ufb01brous tow\\n\\ufb01lter material that has both an adsorbent and an encapsulated \\ufb02avoring agent\\ndispersed throughout the \\ufb01brous tow \\ufb01lter material. (ldj) Because\\nAppellant\\u2019s arguments do not reference the language of any speci\\ufb01c claim\\n(see id. at 6-1 1\\u201c), we shall con\\ufb01ne our discussion to claim 1.6\\nClaim 1 requires, in pertinent part, that the claimed \\ufb01ltered cigarette\\ninclude a second \\ufb01lter segment having \\u201can adsorbent and an encapsulated\\n\\ufb02avoring agent . . . dispersed throughout said second segment of \\ufb01lter\\n[\\ufb01brous tow \\ufb01lter] 1naterial[.]\\u201d Although the Examiner found that Crooks\\nteaches that the adsorbent and \\ufb02avoring agents dispersed in the \\ufb01brous tow\\n(Ans. 5 (citing Figs. 2-4 and 8-10; 1] [0076]), 10 (same)), the Examiner\\nadmits that Crooks does not expressly show such a second \\ufb01lter segment\\n(Ans. 5, 10\\u2018). The Examiner found that Tateno \\u201cteaches that \\ufb01lters may\\ncomprise \\ufb02avorants and a[d]sorbents dispersed in the same \\ufb01lter segment\\n(col. 3 lines 27-41).\\u201d (Id. at 5; but see 10 (\\u201cTATENO is relied upon to teach\\nthe combination of adsorbents and \\ufb02avorants in one segment of a \\ufb01lter.\\u201d).)\\nBoth of these \\ufb01ndings are erroneous. 1\"irst, none of the cited portions\\n\\nof Crooks desc\\ufb01be dispersing adsorbent particles in the \\ufb01brous tow material.\\n\\n6 Claims 22 and 26, the other independent claims in the \\u20198l2 application,\\nalso contain language that\\u2014when given the broadest reasonable\\ninterpretation in light of the \\u20198l2 application\\u2019s Speci\\ufb01cation\\u2014requires a\\n\\ufb01lter segment comprising adsorbent particles and encapsulated \\ufb02avoring\\nagent particles dispersed throughout a \\ufb01brous tow \\ufb01lter material.Appeal 2012-004584\\nApplication ll/537,812\\n\\nFigures 2-4 and 8-10 of Crooks show adsorbent particles 34 con\\ufb01ned to\\ncompartment 32. Crooks Figs. 2-4, 1111 [0050]-[005l], [0055]. Compartment\\n32 does not include any \\ufb01brous tow \\ufb01lter material. Id. at 11 [0050]. ln\\ncontrast, Crooks depicts and describes an embodiment in which ion-\\nexchange resin \\u201cis dispersed or imbedded within a section of \\ufb01lter mate\\ufb01al\\n38\\u201d rather than being con\\ufb01ned in a co111partment 32. Id. at Fig. 9, 11 [O065].\\n\\nSecond, the Examiner erred in \\ufb01nding that Tateno \\u201cteaches that \\ufb01lters\\nmay comprise \\ufb02avorants and a[d]sorbents dispersed in the same \\ufb01lter\\nsegment (col. 3 lines 27-41).\\u201d Tateno describes enclosing a mixture of\\nadsorbent and encapsulating \\ufb02avoring agent particles within a void in a\\nsegment of \\ufb01brous tow material. See Tateno Figs. 3 and 4. Tateno states\\nthat the reason the adsorbent and encapsulated \\ufb02avoring agent particles must\\nbe co\\u2014located is so that the adsorbent particles can accelerate the destruction\\nof the flavo\\ufb01ng agent particles when a smoker crushes or twists the \\ufb01lter to\\nrelease the \\ufb02avoring agent. Ia\\u2019. at col. 3, ll. 27-50. Tateno, therefore, does\\nnot describe or suggest dispersing the adsorbent and \\ufb02avorant particles\\nthroughout the same segment of \\ufb01brous tow material as required by claim 1.\\n\\nBecause these errors are material to the rejection of each of claims 1-\\n15, 19-22, and 24-29, we reverse this rejection.7\\n\\nRejections 2 and 3.

We adopt as our own: (1) the \\ufb01ndings\\nand reasons set forth by the Examiner in the action from w11ic11 this appeal is\\n\\ntaken, and (2) the reasons set forth by the Examiner in the Answer in\\n\\n1 Appellants \\ufb01led a Notice of Appeal on May 1 1, 2010. The date of\\ufb01ling\\nthe Notice of Appeal determines which set of rules applies to an Ex Parte\\nappeal. 1f a notice of appeal is \\ufb01led prior to January 23, 2012, then the 2004\\nversion of the Board Rules last published in the 201 1 edition of Title 37 of\\nthe Code of Federal Regulations (37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.1 et seq.) applies to the\\nappeal.

(Ans. 12-13). Appellants fail to rebut the Exa111iner\\'s\\n\\ufb01ndings.\\n\\nMoreover, we agree with the Examiner the broadest reasonable\\ninterpretation of the claimed \"software serwce does not exclude a particular\\nfunction/software to provide a service such as reviewing/approving/rejectin g\\ninsurance claims, updating insurance databases, and completing the\\n\\ninsurance claim processing as illustrated in FIG. 9.\" (Ans. 15, emphasisAppeal 2011-005649\\nApplication 1 1/262, 143\\n\\nadded).

Specifically, Claim 1 does not recite \"transport paths\" are for the\\ndelivery of software services. The claimed \"transport paths\" are de\\ufb01ned in\\nlimitation [a] as \"interconnect[s]\" between a \"plurality of logical systems.\"\\n\\nC.\\nRegarding the claim 1 limitations: (emphasis added\\u201c)\\n\\n[e] analyzing in the central system the transport paths between\\nthe systems of the group for \\ufb01nding a suitable route through all\\nsystems of the group [el] by accessing transport layout\\ninformation of the software system landscape and project data\\nby the central control system;\\n\\n[f] analyzing whether further development work is required in a\\nlocal part to adapt the software service for the local part;\\n\\nand [g] generating the transport track in the central system in\\naccordance with the analyzing of the transport paths;\\n\\nAppellants contend:\\n\\nWang still fails to discuss how the cenlral syslem analyzes that\\ntransport path, analyzes whether further development work is\\nrequired to adapt the software service, or l1ow the transport\\n\\n5Appeal 2011-005649\\nApplication 1 1/262, 143\\n\\ntrack is generated in accordance with the analysis performed by\\nthe central system.

A broader but\\nreasonable construction merely requires the analysis is done \"in the central\\nsystem.\" Thus, we conclude representative claim 1 does not preclude the\\nuser in Wang and the central system 120 from performing limitations [e].\\n[el], [f], and [g]. (Ans. 4-5, 18-21; Wang 1l[0O36]\\u2018).\\n\\nD.\\n\\nFor these reasons, on this record, we are not persuaded of Examiner\\n\\nerror.

OSINSKI, Administrative Patent Judges.  CRAWFORD, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL    \\x0c\\n Appeal 2011-012352 Application 11/786,572    2STATEMENT OF THE CASE Appellant seeks our review under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 of the Examiner\\u2019s final decision rejecting claims 1 to 18 and 21 to 37.  We have jurisdiction over the appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We REVERSE.  Claim 1 is illustrative:  1.   A method for helping a client check in for a scheduled activity wherein at least first and second subsets of activities occur proximate first and second locations, respectively, the method comprising the steps of: providing a check in resource at the second location for checking clients in for the second subset of activities; associating at least a first electronic kiosk with the first subset activities; positioning the first kiosk at the first location for use by clients to check in for first subset activities; via the first kiosk, receiving identifying information from a first client; identifying at least a first currently scheduled activity for the first client; determining that the first currently scheduled activity is one of the second subset activities; and  via the first kiosk, indicating that the first client cannot check in for the first currently scheduled activity via the first kiosk.   Appellant appeals the following rejection: Claims 1 to 18 and 21 to 37 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as anticipated by Blom (U.S. 2006/0111941 Al; pub. May 25, 2006).   \\x0c\\n Appeal 2011-012352 Application 11/786,572    3ANALYSIS The Appellant argues that Blom does not disclose determining that the first currently scheduled activity is one of the second subset of activities as recited in claim 1.  We agree.  Appellant\\u2019s claim 1 recites a method for helping a client check in for a scheduled activity wherein first and second subsets of activities occur proximate first and second locations respectively.  Appellant\\u2019s Specification states that kiosks are utilized for checking in users and that each kiosk is located proximate to and is associated with locations at which a user can check in for an appointment or activity (para. [0068]; Fig. 1).  A user can only check in at a kiosk that is located proximate to the scheduled activity.  When a user attempts to check in at a kiosk, the kiosk determines whether the user can check in at the kiosk.  Because the kiosks are associated with different locations, the determination of whether the user can check in at a particular kiosk is a determination of whether the user is in the correct location for the appointment or activity (para. [0072]).   We find that Blom discloses an automated patient management system.  The Examiner relies on paragraphs [0005]-[0006] for teaching the disputed subject matter.  We find that these paragraphs of Blom disclose that patients can check in for several services via kiosks.  The Blom system established a process for managing waiting lines in any given area.  After a user has completed the check in process, the system automatically places the user in the queue that has the shortest wait time.  For instance, if a patient comes in for a physical examination and radiological services, the system \\x0c\\n Appeal 2011-012352 Application 11/786,572    4determines which queue (physical examination or radiological services) has the shortest wait time and places the patient in that queue.   We find that the portion of Blom relied on by the Examiner does not disclose determining if a user can check in according to the location of the kiosk.  In fact, the patients in Blom check in before the system makes any determinations.  In addition, the determination that is made in the Blom system is not whether the patient is checking into the kiosk at the location associated with the service desired, but rather which queue for services, no matter the location, has the shortest wait for the patient. In view of the foregoing, we will not sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1.  We will also not sustain the rejection as it is directed to the remaining claims because each of the remaining claims requires the step of determining whether the user can check in to a kiosk based on the location of the kiosk.  DECISION The decision of the Examiner is reversed.   REVERSED    hh   \\x0c'},\n",

App. Br. 12-13.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7\\xa7 134 and 315. The \\u201f992 patent is presently involved in the following infringement litigation proceeding: Whirlpool Corp. v. LG Electronics U.S.A. Inc., No. 10-311 (GMS) D. Del.  App. Br. X. Related Proceedings. In the present reexamination proceeding, the Examiner adopted eighty-five of Requester\\u201fs proposed grounds.  See Patent Owner\\u201fs App. Br. 9-14.3  The Patent Owner appeals all eighty-five of the adopted grounds.  Id. We REVERSE.                                                             3 3rd Party Requester, LG Electronics Inc., submitted its original request for reexamination with eighty-eight proposed grounds of rejection.  See Request for Inter Partes Reexamination dated December 7, 2011, Appendix B.  The Examiner purported to consider a total of ninety rejections.  RAN 42; see also RAN 4-41.  The only rejections purportedly not adopted by the Examiner were those submitted in Requester\\u201fs Comments dated June 18, 2012, which were rejections under 35 U.S.C \\xa7 112.  See RAN 42-46.  The Examiner also withdrew all or at least portions of some rejections due to the Patent Owner\\u201fs cancellation of certain claims.  See RAN 46-48.

THE REJECTIONS ON APPEAL The Examiner made a total of eighty-five rejections, which we will not list individually here, but which may be found listed in Appellant\\u201fs Brief.  See App. Br. 9-14. ANALYSIS Although there are a total of eighty-five rejections on appeal, these rejections essentially boil down to three major issues.  First, whether independent claim 16, the only independent claim on appeal, requires two distinct doors or whether a single door may accomplish the functional language relating to the door recitations.  Second, whether the Yasuzo reference discloses a single embodiment as depicted in figures 17-20 or whether two embodiments are disclosed in those same figures.  And third, whether the Examiner articulated a reason with rational underpinnings as to why one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009719 Reexamination Control 95/001,841 Patent US 7,386,992 B2  5 incorporate both an ice dispenser and a separate door in the same ice compartment sufficient to support the obviousness rejections.  These three issues are essentially determinative of the rejections on appeal.  Furthermore, we note that the Patent Owner does not contest any of the rejections of the dependent claims separately from the rejections of claim 16.  See App. Br. 15, 46.  Accordingly, all rejections stand or fall based on our determination with respect to the rejections of claim 16. Does Claim 16 Require One or Two Distinct Doors? Claim 16 recites in the preamble \\u201ca fresh food compartment with a door,\\u201d and more specifically an ice dispenser \\u201cin the door,\\u201d as well as \\u201ca door to sealingly engage the ice compartment.\\u201d  Requester and the Examiner agree that these limitations can be met by a single door performing functions pertaining to each recited door.  See, e.g., Ans. 13-14,  Requester\\u201fs Comments 9-11.  According to the Requester, \\u201crefrigerators in which a single door closes both the ice compartment and the fresh food compartment, and refrigerators in which two separate doors close the fresh food compartment and the ice compartment\\u201d are both covered by claim 16.  Requester\\u201fs Comments at 9.  Requester further explains that this is so because \\u201c[t]he specification favors such an interpretation because it describes both an embodiment in which a single door closes the fresh food compartment and the ice compartment, and an embodiment in which two separate doors close the fresh food compartment and the ice compartment.\\u201d  Id. 9-10.  Requester also asserts that interpreting the claims to cover only the latter embodiment is contrary to a proper claim construction and cautions that \\u201ca particular embodiment appearing in the written description may not \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009719 Reexamination Control 95/001,841 Patent US 7,386,992 B2  6 be read into a claim when the claim language is broader than the embodiment.\\u201d  Id. 11 (citing M.P.E.P. \\xa7 2110.01.II).  Requester additionally states that \\u201c[t]he Federal Circuit has held that absent probative evidence to the contrary, claims should be interpreted to include all disclosed embodiments.\\u201d  Id. 10 (citing Oatey Co. v. IPS Corp., 514 F.3d 1271, 1277 (Fed. Cir. 2008)). As the Patent Owner points out, however, \\u201c[i]f the same door [were] being referred to in both claim elements, the claim would have recited \\u201cthe door\\u201d as opposed to \\u201ca door to sealingly engage the ice compartment.\\u201d  (App. Br. 16.)  We agree.  \\u201cWhere a claim lists elements separately, \\u201ethe clear implication of the claim language\\u201f is that those elements are \\u201edistinct component[s]\\u201f of the patented invention.\\u201d  Becton, Dickinson & Co. v. Tyco Healthcare Grp., LP, 616 F.3d 1249, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  Accordingly, we are neither reading an embodiment from the Specification into claim 16 nor are we interpreting the claim in a manner more narrowly than required.   While it may be true that claims should generally cover all embodiments if possible, there is certainly no requirement that a patentee claim all disclosed embodiments.  In this instance, claim 16 merely covers one of the two aforementioned embodiments.  The rationale in Becton is more applicable in the present appeal than that of the more generalized rule set forth in Oatey.  As such, we conclude that claim 16 requires two distinct doors and that any rejection utilizing a single door to meet both of the door limitations is improper.  Accordingly, the portions of rejections 1, 10, 12, 21, and 32 that rely upon a single door are reversed. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009719 Reexamination Control 95/001,841 Patent US 7,386,992 B2  7 Do Either of the Lee References Disclosure of a Shutter Support an Anticipation Rejection? Each of the rejections of claim 16 as anticipated by either of Lee \\u201f967 or Lee \\u201f177 alternatively relies on a single door to satisfy both of the door recitations of claim 16, or relies on a shutter, e.g., shutter 414 of Lee \\u201f967 (Ans. 4), to perform the function of sealingly engaging the ice compartment.  As noted above, we do not agree that a single door may properly be the basis of an anticipation rejection of claim 16.  We thus address the Examiner\\u201fs alternative rejection utilizing shutter 41 to teach the second door.   In describing the various components of Lee \\u201f967, the Examiner specifically notes that Lee \\u201f967 discloses \\u201can ice compartment (61) within the fresh food compartment (Fig. 6); an ice maker (10) in the ice compartment; [and] an ice storage bin (20) in the ice compartment,\\u201d among other things.  RAN 3.  The Examiner then goes on to explain that \\u201cLee \\u201f967 also discloses a shutter 41 (door) that selectively opens and closes a discharge opening 21 of the case 61 (see FIGS. 3 and 6) (Col. 6:49-50, 65-66; Col. 7:9-10, 14-15).\\u201d  Id. at 4.  The Examiner further finds that \\u201cdischarge opening 21 delivers ice from the container 20 to the chute 54.\\u201d  Id. This description, however, contains a flaw.  As can be seen in figure 3 of Lee \\u201f967, shutter 41 is a part of ice container 20, not a part of ice compartment 61.  As described in the Specification, \\u201cthe case 61 has an icemaker 10 and an ice container 20 provided therein.\\u201d  Lee \\u201f967, col. 9, ll.                                                            4 Lee \\u201f177 discloses a similar mechanism (shutter \\u201e530) that operates in essentially the same manner as shutter 41, and so we will not discuss Lee \\u201f177 further. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009719 Reexamination Control 95/001,841 Patent US 7,386,992 B2  8 13-14 (emphasis added).  It is therefore improper to state, as the Examiner does, that shutter 41 \\u201copens and closes a discharge opening 21 of the case 61.\\u201d RAN 4 (emphasis added).   Discharge opening 21 is part of container 20, not \\u201cof the case 61.\\u201d  As the Patent Owner states \\u201c[a]t best, the shutter 41 may engage the ice container 20, not the ice compartment 61.\\u201d  App. Br. 17.  It is important to note that claim 16 requires that the door \\u201csealingly engage the ice compartment,\\u201d not the ice container.   Furthermore, based upon the function of shutter 41, which is merely to operate as a selector to shuttle ice past a portion of the dispensing opening to a crusher if the user selects crushed ice, there is no reason to believe that the claimed sealing occurs, even with respect to opening 21.  Shutter 41 exists only to prevent whole ice from dropping down the dispenser opening into a user\\u201fs glass, so there is no need for shutter 41 to have any additional capability other than preventing whole ice cubes from dropping out of ice container 20.  Accordingly, with this function in mind, we do not see any factual basis for Requester\\u201fs assertion that the shutters of the Lee references \\u201cprevent outside air from traveling into the ice compartment.\\u201d  Requester\\u201fs Comments 16.   We further note that Requester also incorrectly characterizes the function of shutter 41.  Requester asserts that \\u201cshutter 41 covers the complete ice discharge opening 21 rather than a portion of the ice discharge opening\\u201d and that \\u201c[i]t is only in embodiments where both crushed and uncrushed ice are discharged through the ice dispenser, does the discharge opening 21 even have first and second discharge openings 21a, 21b, and the shutter selectively 41 opens them.  Col. 6[]:63-66, 7:8-13.\\u201d  Requester\\u201fs \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009719 Reexamination Control 95/001,841 Patent US 7,386,992 B2  9 Comments 15.  As we understand the disclosure, because shutter 41\\u201fs only function is to bypass opening 21b for whole ice, shutter 41 only exists in embodiments where a user may alternatively select crushed or whole ice.  In this regard, not only is shutter 41 only interacting with ice container 20, as opposed to the claimed ice compartment 61, but, as the Patent owner states, \\u201c[it] only ever closes discharge opening 21 b\\u2026, but it never closes discharge opening 21 a.\\u201d  App. Br. 18.  Accordingly, shutter 41 cannot meet the limitation of the second recited door because the shutter closes an opening in the ice container, not the ice compartment, and when in use, shutter 41 closes only portion 21b of opening 21 while leaving portion 21a open at all times and thus does not seal as claimed.  As such, the portion of anticipation rejections 1 and 21 relying on the shutters 41 and 530 as disclosed in the Lee references are reversed. Does Yasuzo Disclose One or Two Embodiments Via Figures 17-20? Both the Examiner and the Requester agree that Yasuzo discloses a single embodiment in figures 17-20.  See e.g., Ans. 19, Requester\\u201fs Comments 7-8.  Requester asserts that \\u201cYasuzo clearly discloses that the ice dispenser and the ice compartment door may be incorporated in the same embodiment (specifically the 5th embodiment).\\u201d  Requester\\u201fs Comments 8.  Requester further asserts that paragraphs 102 and 103 describing Figures 17 and 19 both refer to the same embodiment.  Id.   The Patent Owner, however, asserts that \\u201cthe refrigerators shown in these four figures cannot be the same embodiment [because] Figures 19/20 depict[] a refrigerator having five compartments whereas the refrigerator in Figures 17/18 only has four compartments.\\u201d  Reply Br. 11.  Further, as is \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009719 Reexamination Control 95/001,841 Patent US 7,386,992 B2  10 clearly shown in figure 18, door 77 is in the same general location as cup receptacle 79 depicted in figure 20.  It does not appear possible that both door 77 and cup receptacle 79 may occupy the same space.  In addition, it is clear that ice-making tray 27 is positioned above cup receptacle 79 as depicted in figure 19, whereas ice making tray 27 is positioned even with door 77 as depicted in figure 17.  Thus, these cannot be the same embodiment.  Accordingly, we agree with the Patent Owner that Yasuzo\\u201fs figures 17/18 disclose one embodiment, while figures 19/20 disclose an alternate embodiment.  Therefore, any attempt to create an anticipatory rejection from these two embodiments is improper.  Accordingly, the anticipation rejection 43 based upon Yasuzo is reversed. Obviousness of an Ice Dispenser in Combination with an Additional \\u201c[D]oor to [S]ealingly [E]ngage the [I]ce [C]ompartment\\u201d The majority of the remainder of the rejections of claim 16 rely on some combination of references where one reference discloses an access door of some sort into the ice making/storage compartment and another reference discloses a refrigerator having an ice dispenser, but where the combination of both an ice dispenser and a separate, second door is not found in a single reference.5  The Examiner\\u201fs basis for such combinations is                                                            5 The Examiner also makes an obviousness rejection over Lee \\u201f967 alone and merely states without evidentiary support that doors \\u201cfor various compartments per se are well known, and thus to provide the ice compartment of Lee et al[.] with a door for the purpose of providing separate access to the compartment is considered to be a well[-]known and obvious expedient to one of ordinary skill in the art.\\u201d  RAN 5 (citing Office Action of May 18, 2007).  This rejection is subject to the same analysis as the multi-reference obviousness rejections discussed herein. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009719 Reexamination Control 95/001,841 Patent US 7,386,992 B2  11 exemplified by the Examiner\\u201fs explanation for combining Lee \\u201f967 with any one of Gould, Grimes, or Okada: It would have been obvious for a person of ordinary skill to incorporate the teaching of the ice compartment door from any one of Gould, Grimes, or Okada into the refrigerator of Lee '967 to provide access to ice in case 6l. Such a combination would apply known features, such as an ice compartment door, to achieve a predictable result of providing a user access to the ice in the ice compartment. Ans. 5.   It may be true that, once a decision is made to combine an ice dispenser and the Examiner\\u201fs choice of prior art access doors, such a combination would apply known features to achieve a predictable result.  The Examiner, however, does not provide a reason with rational underpinnings that explains why one would have chosen to combine both a prior art access door and a dispenser in a single refrigerator in the first place.  The Supreme Court has provided instruction that \\u201ca patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was, independently, known in the prior art\\u201d and further that \\u201cit can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does.\\u201d  KSR Int\\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007). As is clear from the dates of references cited by the Examiner, both refrigerators with ice dispensers as well as refrigerators having ice makers with an access door were well known in the art as of the time of the Patent Owner\\u201fs invention.  Despite this, the Examiner was unable to find any single \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009719 Reexamination Control 95/001,841 Patent US 7,386,992 B2  12 reference that teaches both an ice dispenser and a separate access door of the type chosen by the Examiner in one refrigerator so as to meet the limitations recited in claim 16.  In fact, the only reference that discloses both of these features is Yasuzo, and as noted above, Yasuzo teaches that these two aspects of refrigerators with ice makers are functional alternatives to each other.   We need not address the various arguments regarding the supposed technical ease with which one of skill in the art could have combined these two elements in a single device because the record before us does not provide any reasonable basis with rational underpinnings for doing so in the first place.  The record appears to indicate that one of skill in the art would view an access door to an ice maker as disclosed in any of Grimes, Gould, Okada, or Yasuzo as an alternative to an ice maker with a dispenser.  Accordingly, we do not believe the Examiner has stated a proper basis to sustain a prima facie case of obviousness for combining the identified access doors of any of Grimes, Gould, or Okada with the refrigerator having a dispenser as disclosed in any of Lee \\u201f967, Lee \\u201f177, Najewicz, Kim, Kunio, or Cur.  As such, we reverse all of the rejections of claim 16 as obvious over the combination of these references.  These include rejections 3, 4, 24, 34, 74, and 83.  Furthermore, as the Patent Owner points out, \\u201c[t]he Examiner refers to the same faulty rationale discussed above to combine the conveyors and dispensers disclosed in Hynes, von Blanquet, and Thompson into the refrigerators of Najewicz, Grimes, Okada, or Kunio.\\u201d  Reply Br. 14-15.  Additionally, we agree, that \\u201c[t]he Examiner uses this same assertion of \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009719 Reexamination Control 95/001,841 Patent US 7,386,992 B2  13 undisclosed modifications to combine the refrigerator of Cur with the conveyors and dispensers of Fisher, Buchser, and Shin.\\u201d  Reply Br. 15.  Rather than incorporating an access door into a refrigerator having an ice dispenser, these rejections merely do the reverse and incorporate an ice dispenser into refrigerators that disclose a door of the ice maker that is distinct from the fresh food compartment door.  Such combinations suffer the same defect discussed above in that an adequate reason with rational underpinnings has not been provided.  Our interpretation of the prior art of record is that ice dispensers are alternatives to the types of access doors used in the rejections and the Examiner has not provided persuasive analysis to the contrary that is adequate to support the obviousness rejections. As such, we reverse these rejections as well, which include rejections 55 and 64.6 Dependent Claims Each of the rejections of dependent claims 17 and 20-75 relies upon the improper rejections of claim 16.  None of the additional references or rationales provided in the rejections of the dependent claims cures the deficiencies stated above with respect to the rejections of claim 16.  Accordingly, the rejections of claims 17 and 20-75 are all reversed for the                                                            6 We note that the Requester also points to various portions of the prosecution history that allegedly contain statements of the Examiner that remain unrebutted and thus, purport to negate various arguments of the Patent Owner made in this appeal.  See e.g. Requester\\u201fs Comments 4, 13.  We do not agree that the Patent Owner\\u201fs mere silence regarding certain statements in the vast record before us amounts to an acceptance that would negate further argument in this appeal, given that the Patent Owner gained allowance of the claims as originally issued and has maintained the impropriety of the rejections as a whole throughout the reexamination prosecution.    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009719 Reexamination Control 95/001,841 Patent US 7,386,992 B2  14 same reasons as stated above with respect to claim 16, which includes rejections 2, 5-9, 11, 13-20, 22, 23, 25-31, 33, 35-42, 44-54, 56-63, 65-73, 75-82, 84, and 85.

YANG, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL This is a decision on appeal1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 involving claims to methods for purging air from dual head injectors.  The Examiner rejected claims 57, 58, and 68-80 as obvious.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b). We affirm.                                            1 Appellant identifies Mallinckrodt Inc. as the Real Party in Interest.  (App. Br. 1.) \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012184  Application 10/780,269   2  STATEMENT OF THE CASE Claims 57, 58, and 68-80 are rejected and on appeal.  They are directed to methods of using dual head injectors, and specifically, of purging air from such injectors.  The Examiner rejected the claims under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over the combination of Emig2 and Stellant.3 Claims 57 and 71 are independent claims.  Claim 57 is representative of the subject matter on appeal.  It reads: 57.  A method of using a dual head injector, the method comprising: mounting a first syringe to the injector; mounting a second syringe to the injector; coupling a first section of Y-tubing to the first syringe; coupling a second section of the Y-tubing to the second syringe . . . ; initiating a purging operation . . . wherein the first syringe comprises contrast media prior to the initiation of the purging operation, wherein the second syringe comprises saline prior to the initiation of the purging operation, and wherein the purging operation comprises: advancing a first plunger drive ram of the injector to move a plunger of the first syringe to a first predetermined stop point where the plunger of the first syringe stops, wherein the advancing of the first plunger drive ram purges air from the first syringe and the first section of Y-tubing and fills the first section of the Y-tubing with contrast media from the first syringe . . . ; and advancing a second plunger drive ram of the injector to move a plunger of the second syringe to a second predetermined stop point where the plunger of the second syringe stops, wherein the advancing of the second plunger                                            2 Emig et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,471,674 B1, issued on Oct. 29, 2002.  3 Medrad, Inc., STELLANT CT INJECTION SYSTEM, Operation Manual Catalog #SOM 700 EN (2003). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012184  Application 10/780,269   3  drive ram purges air from the second syringe, the second section of the Y-tubing, the intersection of the first, second, and third sections of the Y-tubing, and the third section of the Y-tubing, wherein the advancing of the first plunger drive ram occurs before the advancing of the second plunger drive ram, and wherein the advancing of the second plunger drive ram comprises filling each of the second and third sections of the Y-tubing with saline from the second syringe; and initiating an injection procedure . . . . (Emphasis added.)  DISCUSSION The only issue Appellant raises on appeal is whether the combination of Emig and Stellant would render the claimed invention obvious, even though neither reference explicitly discloses the sequence of the steps of advancing the two plunger drive rams as recited in the claims. In rejecting claim 57, the Examiner found that Emig and Stellant disclose all the limitations except the sequence of advancing the two plunger drive rams.  (Final Rej. 4, Ans. 6.)  Citing column 6, lines 6-19 of Emig, the Examiner acknowledged that \\u201cit is not clear if Emig et al in view of Stellant explicitly disclose wherein the advancing of the first plunger drive ram occurs before the advancing of the second plunger drive ram.\\u201d  (Final Rej. 4; Ans. 6.)  Nevertheless, according to the Examiner, It would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to modify the purge protocol as taught by Emig et al with [the advancing of] the first plunger drive ram occurring before the advancing of the second plunger drive ram since changes in sequence are prima facie obvious in the absence of new or unexpected results (See MPEP 2144.04(IV)(C)).  Having the first plunger drive ram \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012184  Application 10/780,269   4  advancing before the second plunger drive ram does not provide a new or unexpected result in this case. (Final Rej. 4-5; Ans. 6-7.) Appellant argues that the Examiner erred in relying upon the presumption that \\u201cthere are only two options for undertaking a purging operation: 1) a saline push followed by a contrast push; or 2) a contrast push followed by a saline push.\\u201d  (App. Br. 11.)  According to Appellant, \\u201c[a] purging operation could be configured in any appropriate manner, for instance one or more saline pushes, one or more contrast pushes, and in any combination (e.g., a saline push, followed by a contrast push, followed by another saline push).\\u201d  (Id.)  Appellant asserts that \\u201c[b]ased upon the vast option set for configuring a purging operation (which plunger drive ram to move at what time, and for how long), one skilled in the art simply would not be motivated to modify the teachings of Emig and/or Stellant OMC in any manner that would [yield] Appellant\\u2019s invention of claim 57.\\u201d4  (Id. at 12.) A preponderance of the evidence supports the Examiner\\u2019s position that the claimed two-step purging operation, i.e., \\u201cpush the contrast first followed by a saline push,\\u201d would have been obvious.  (Ans. 10.)  This is so even if, as Appellant would like us to find, there are more than two purging                                            4 At one point, Appellant argues that \\u201cEmig could be interpreted to define a purging operation that uses a saline prime, followed by a contrast prime. This is the exact opposite of the purging sequence set forth in claim 57 . . . .\\u201d  (App. Br. 9.)  Upon reviewing Emig, we find no merit in this assertion.  Indeed, a few pages later, in the same brief, Appellant concedes that \\u201cEmig does not explicitly disclose any sequence at all for the saline prime and contrast prime addressed therein.\\u201d  (Id. at 13.) \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012184  Application 10/780,269   5  sequences because as the Examiner correctly pointed out, \\u201cchanges in sequence are prima facie obvious in the absence of new or unexpected results.\\u201d  (Final Rej. 5; Ans. 7.)     Appellant faults the Examiner for relying on MPEP \\xa7 2144.04(IV)(C) to support the obviousness rejection.  (App. Br. 12-13.)  Appellant first argues that because he has demonstrated the criticality of the sequence in the purging operation, \\u201creliance by the Examiner on the rationale of MPEP \\xa7 2144.04(IV)(C) is inappropriate.\\u201d  (Id. at 12.)  According to Appellant: [T]he order of the advancement of the first and second syringe plunger drivers for a purging operation in accordance with claim 57 has been the focus of prosecution.  Moreover, such a specific order reduces the waste of relatively expensive contrast, purges air prior to injection, and does so in what is in effect a simple two-step process (i.e., two syringe plunger drive ram movements). (Id.)   Appellant has not pointed to any disclosure in the Specification, and we find none, that support this argument of criticality.  (See Ans. 10-11 (stating that Appellant \\u201cdoes not mention \\u2018waste,\\u2019 \\u2018expense,\\u2019 or \\u2018simple\\u2019 in the specification as originally filed.  Simply put, the Appellant lacks support for the purported criticality in the originally filed specification\\u201d)).  The Examiner is also correct in the observation that Emig \\u201cdiscloses the exact reasoning and criticality\\u201d for the air purging steps.  (Id. at 11.)  Indeed, Emig teaches \\u201cpriming\\u201d of the fluid delivery path \\u201cto remove air from the fluid path and minimize wastage of contrast medium.\\u201d  (Emig, col. 6, ll. 9-11.)  Appellant has not provided any persuasive reasoning or credible evidence that the claimed invention achieves any advantage over, or even any result different from, Emig.  See In re Hampel, 162 F.2d 483, 485 (CCPA 1947) \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012184  Application 10/780,269   6  (upholding affirmance of obviousness rejection because \\u201c[t]here is nothing in the instant record which indicates that the particular order of steps produces results differing in any way from those which would be brought about if another order of steps were followed\\u201d). Noting that the heading of the MPEP section is \\u201cChanges in Sequence of Adding Ingredients,\\u201d Appellant also contends that the legal precedent cited therein \\u201con its face is inapplicable to claim 57.\\u201d  (App. Br. 13.)  We find Appellant\\u2019s argument unpersuasive.  As the Examiner correctly pointed out, \\u201cthe cases cited in 2144.04(IV)(c) are directed to processes and the obviousness of ordering of the known steps within that process.\\u201d  (Ans. 11.)  For example, in Ex parte Rubin, the claims were directed to a method of forming a laminated sheet requiring first impregnating the sheet with a thermosetting material and then coating it with a metallic film.  128 USPQ 440, 441 (BPAI 1959).  The examiner decided that the prior art reference disclosing a process of making a laminated sheet with the two steps reversed rendered the claims prima facie obvious.  Id.  Because \\u201cno unexpected result is obtained by reversing the order of steps,\\u201d the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed the obviousness rejection.  Id. at 442.  See also In re Burhans, 154 F.2d 690, 692 (CCPA 1946) (affirming obviousness rejection \\u201cin the absence of any proof in the record that the order of performing the steps produces any new and unexpected results\\u201d). Similarly in this case, Appellant points to no evidence in the record showing that the claimed order of steps produces results differing in any way from those which would be brought about if another order of steps were \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012184  Application 10/780,269   7  followed.  Absent such new and unexpected results, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 57.5  Claims 58 and 68-70 fall with claim 57.  Appellant argues that the deficiency of Emig in view of Stellant is also applicable to claim 71.  (App. Br. 16.)  This argument is not persuasive as we found no deficiency in the combination of Emig and Stellant.  Thus, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 71 for the same reason discussed above.  Claims 72-80 fall with claim 71.  SUMMARY We affirm the rejections on appeal.   TIME PERIOD FOR RESPONSE No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a).    AFFIRMED   cdc                                            5 Appellant also contends that the Examiner\\u2019s other rationales supporting the obviousness rejection are flawed.  (See App. Br. 13-15.)  We do not address those arguments as we affirm based on the Examiner\\u2019s first rationale.  \\x0c'},\n",

We have jurisdiction\\npursuant to 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6.Appeal 2012-009374\\nApplication 11/657,033\\n\\nAppellant\\u2019s claimed invention is directed to a method of\\nmanufacturing smoking articles comprising a rod of smokable material and a\\nwrapper co111prising tobacco leaf material circumscribing the rod (Spec.\\n\\nll 0002\\u201c).\\nClaim 12 is illustrative and reproduced below:\\n\\n12. A method for the continuous manufacture of smoking\\narticles comprising: a rod of smokable material, a \\ufb01lter, and a\\nwrapper of tobacco leaf mate\\ufb01al circumscribing the rod and\\n\\ufb01lter, the method comprising:\\n\\ncutting a plurality of tobacco leaf portions and\\ntessellating the cut leaf portions to overlap each other and form\\nan elongate web of tobacco leaf material;\\n\\nconveying the elongate web of tobacco leaf material\\nalong a pre\\u2014deter1nined path;\\n\\nrepeatedly severing the elongate web to form a\\nsuccession of discrete wrappers;\\n\\ncontacting each of the discrete wrappers witl1 a respective\\none of a succession of rods of smokable material and axially\\naligned abutting \\ufb01lters; and\\n\\nconvoluting the discrete wrappers around the rods of\\nsmokable material and \\ufb01lters to the form the smoking articles\\nso that longitudinal edges of the wrappers are substantially\\nparallel to a longitudinal axes of the rods of smokable material\\nand axially aligned abutting \\ufb01lters.\\n\\nIn addition to asserted admitted prior art, the Examiner relies on the\\n\\nfollowing prior art references as evidence in rejecting the appealed claims:\\n\\nLindgren US 3,352,308 Nov. 14, 1967\\nGoslin US 4,286,605 Sep. 1, l98l\\nSinclair US 6,742,525 B2 Jun. 1,2004\\n\\nClaims 12, 15-22, and 24 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a) as\\n\\nbeing unpatentable over Sinclair in view of alleged admitted prior art inAppeal 2012-009374\\nApplication 11/657,033\\n\\nAppellant\\u2019s disclosure and Lindgren. Claim 23 stands rejected under\\n35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a) as being unpatentable over Sinclair in View of alleged\\nadmitted prior art in Appellant\\u2019s disclosure, Lindgren and Goslin.\\n\\nWe reverse the stated rejections. Our reasoning follows.\\n\\nlt is well settled that the burden of establishing a prima facie case of\\nnon-patentability resides with the Examiner. See In re Piasecki, 745 F.2d\\nl468, l472 (Fed. Cir. l984). Here, the Examiner relies on a combination of\\nSinclair, alleged admitted prior art in Appellant\\u2019s disclosure, and Lindgren\\nto underpin the base rejection and the separately stated obviousness rejection\\nof dependent claim 23. However, the proposed co111bination lacks the\\nprovision of an adequate supporting rationale being supplied by the\\nExaminer that would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to arrive at a\\nmethod corresponding to the method of sole independent claim 12 based on\\nthe proposed selection and combination of disparate pieces taken from the\\nseveral methods set forth in the separate prior art documents and asserted\\nadmissions accumulated by and relied upon by the Examiner.\\n\\nIn particular and as argued by Appellant, Sinclair is directed to\\nmaking a tube-shaped wrapper product from sheet material formed using\\ntobacco leaves, which tube product is disclosed as being supplied to a\\ncustomer for use as a shell for making a custom cigar product with the\\naddition of the desired tobacco \\ufb01ll material being performed by the customer\\n(Sinclair, abstract, col. 1, l. 29 \\u2014 col.2, l. 22; App. Br. 7-10; Reply Br. 2, 3).\\n\\nContrarily. the Examiner broadly refers to alleged admitted prior art\\nprocessing steps dealing with cigarette manufacture, as may be gleaned from\\nportions of W 0043, 0057, and/or 0058 of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification, and\\n\\nthe Examiner maintains that one of ordinary skill in the art would haveAppeal 2012-009374\\nApplication 11/657,033\\n\\nfound it obvious to use the web material of Sinclair \\u201cin a conventional\\nlongitudinal seam wrapping process to form an attractive smoking article\\nwitl1 predictable success\\u201d (Ans. 5). However, the Examiner l1as not detailed\\nhow Sinclair\\u2019s teachings directed to making a custom cigar tube-shaped\\nwrapper designed to be \\ufb01lled by a customer with their selected tobacco \\ufb01ll\\nmaterial would have suggested a modi\\ufb01cation to the asserted admitted prior\\nart processing steps dealing with cigarette manufacture as may be gleaned\\nfrom portions of W 0043, 0057, and/or 0058 of the Appellant\\u2019s Speci\\ufb01cation\\nand Lindgren\\u2019s teachings dealing with particular shaped portions cut fro111\\ntobacco leaves that are assembled for forming a tobacco band (Ans. 5, 6).\\n\\nSigni\\ufb01cantly, the Examiner l1as not supported the assertion that\\n\\u201cSinclair clearly shows that its tessel[l]ated tobacco leaf wrapper would have\\nbeen useful for combination with an ordinary continuous method of\\nwrapping of rods of smokable material with a longitudinal seam (i.e.[,]\\ncommon cigarette production)\\u201d with any citations to Sinclair that\\nsubstantiate this assertion (Ans. 7\\u201c). As argued by Appellant. the wrapper\\nproduct of Sinclair is a tube shaped wrapper product designed to be used for\\nmaking a custom cigar, which tube products would not be suitable for\\npassing through a continuous cigarette manufacturing process (Reply\\nBr. 2, 3).\\n\\nIt follows that the Examiner has not discharged the burden of\\nsupplying an adequate explanation as to why one of ordinary skill in the art\\nwould have been led to the proposed modi\\ufb01cations of the assembled asserted\\nadmitted prior art cigarette processing steps based on the disparate teachings\\nof Sinclair concerning the manufacture of a custom cigar shell. ln particular,\\n\\nthe Examiner has not established that the custom cigar formation method ofAppeal 2012-009374\\n\\nApplication 11/657,033\\n\\nSinclair instructs or suggests to one of ordinary skill in the art a modi\\ufb01cation\\nof the asserted admitted prior art continuous cigarette manufacturing\\nprocess, much less a particular modi\\ufb01cation that would have resulted in a\\nprocess corresponding to the claim 12 1netl1od so as to ful\\ufb01ll the Examiner\\u2019s\\nburden of presenting a prima facie case of obviousness, as urged by\\nAppellant (App. Br. 7-10; Reply Br. 2, 3\\u201c).\\n\\nNor has the Examiner convincingly explained how any of the other\\nprior art references as broadly aggregated and conclusively applied in\\nrejecting the appealed claims, including the additional reference assembled\\nin separately rejecting dependent claim 23, make up for the de\\ufb01ciency in\\nsupplying an adequate teaching and/or suggestion that would have led an\\nordinarily skilled artisan to modify the asserted admitted prior art process.\\n\\nIn this regard, \\u201crejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained\\nby mere conclusory statements; instead, there must be some articulated\\nreasoning with so111e rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of\\nobviousness\" being asserted. In re Kuhn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir.\\n2006) (quoted with approval in KSR Inl\\u2019l Co. v. Tele/lex Inc., 550 U.S. 398,\\n418 (2007)). After all, rejections based on \\xa7 l03(a) must rest on a factual\\nbasis with these facts being properly set forth and interpreted without\\nhindsight reconstruction of the invention fro111 the prior art. See In re\\nWarner, 379 F.2d l0l l, l0l7 (CCPA 1967).\\n\\nOn this record, we reverse the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejections of\\nthe appealed claims.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe Examiner\\u2019s decision to reject the appealed clai111s is reversed.\\n\\nREVERSEDAppeal 2012-009374\\nApplication 11/657,033\\n\\nkm111'},\n",

The rejection of Claims 1, 18, 26, 38, 40, and 52 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7102(e) as being anticipated Hutchison. 2. The rejection of Claims 13, 26, 33, and 38 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7103(a) as being unpatentable over Hutchison and Churchill. 3.

The rejection of Claims 1, 18, 40, and 52 under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being obvious over Churchill and Yahoo! Auctions Payment Options.   ISSUES 1.  Under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e), has the Examiner erred by rejecting claims 13, 26, 33, and 38 as anticipated by Churchill? 2.  Under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e), has the Examiner erred by rejecting claims 26 and 38 as anticipated by Hutchison? 3.  Under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a), has the Examiner erred by rejecting claims 13, 26, 33 and 38 as unpatentable over the cited prior art? \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009107 Reexamination Control 95/001,590 Patent 7,627,528 B2   6   ANALYSIS  The Patent Owner groups claims 13 and 33 as Group I and claims 26 and 28 as Group II.  See PO App. Br. 5.  We address each group separately below.    THE ANTICIPATION REJECTION OVER CHURCHILL Claims 13 and 33 (Group I) The Patent Owner asserts that the Examiner erred in finding that Churchill discloses \\u201cproviding the user with an option to enable loaning of funds if a payment source corresponding to the user has insufficient funds for effecting payment for at least one transaction conducted via the electronic auction web site,\\u201d as recited in claims 13 and 33.  PO App. Br. 27.   In particular, the Patent Owner identifies that the claimed \\u201coption\\u201d refers to \\u201cproviding the user with a choice to enable loaning funds\\u201d and maintains that this option is absent in Churchill.  PO App. Br. 20.  To support this argument, however, the Patent Owner erroneously equates the Yahoo! Auction system\\u2019s enabling a credit feature to enabling loaning of funds.  See PO App. Br. 19-20 (asserting that Churchill fails to present a user with the option to enable loaning of funds because \\u201cthe Yahoo! Auction System unilaterally makes a determination of whether to enable a credit feature\\u2026.\\u201d) To the contrary, Churchill expressly describes that the Yahoo! Auction system, once the credit feature is enabled by the system, presents \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009107 Reexamination Control 95/001,590 Patent 7,627,528 B2   7 the option of using the credit feature, i.e. loaning of funds, to the user.  See TPR Resp. Br. 7 (citing Churchill at 45:42-56).  More specifically, when a user is configuring a maximum bid amount and the user\\u2019s account does not have enough credit points to cover the maximum bid entered, Churchill explains that  \\u2026the Yahoo! Auction System will either disallow the participation of the user in that auction, suggest a lower maximum bid amount that can be covered by the user\\' account balance, or allow the user to participate provided that the credit line in the user\\'s account is not exceeded.  Normally, the Yahoo! Auction System will prompt the user with the first two options\\u2014disallow participation and suggest a lower maximum bid amount. The third option is available [to a user] provided that the Yahoo! Auction System has enabled the credit feature of the user\\'s account.   Churchill 45:.42-54 (emphasis added).    In other words, the Yahoo Auction System determines whether the credit feature is available to a particular user.  As the Patent Owner acknowledges, the Yahoo! Auction System reviews a user\\u2019s account and provides a marker in the user\\u2019s account indicating that that user may use credit points.  PO App. Br. 21-22 (citing Churchill 53:49- 54:9).   As such, the Yahoo! Auction System does not unilaterally loan funds or provide credit points as asserted by the Patent Owner, but instead merely determines whether the particular user is permitted to receive a loan or use the credit feature.  When there are insufficient funds, a user is prompted with options, including a third option of using credit when the user\\u2019s account has the credit enabled marker.  See TPR Resp. Br. 7 (citing Churchill at 45:42-\\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009107 Reexamination Control 95/001,590 Patent 7,627,528 B2   8 56).  We are therefore not persuaded that Churchill fails to disclose providing the user with the option of enabling loaning of funds.   The Patent Owner additionally contends that because Churchill fails to disclose providing the option of enabling loaning of funds, Churchill cannot disclose \\u201creceiving authorization in response to the option\\u201d and \\u201cloaning funds\\u2026if\\u2026authorization from the user has been received.\\u201d  See PO App. Br. 22-23 and 27.  We likewise find these arguments unavailing.   Accordingly, we affirm the rejection of claims 13 and 33 as anticipated by Churchill.      Claims 26 and 38 (Group II) We are also not persuaded by the Patent Owner that Churchill fails to disclose or suggest receiving payment authorization from a user prior to a conclusion of an electronic auction to automatically loan funds thereto following the conclusion of the electronic auction, as required by claims 26 and 38.   The Patent Owner acknowledges that Churchill describes that \\u201cthe Yahoo! Auction System allows the human bidder to automate his actions so that he does not have to be physically present at this [sic] computer to locate an auction, submit a bid, or finalize a sale.\\u201d  PO App. Br. 25.  But the Patent Owner asserts that automating the finalization of the sale does not entail the Yahoo! Auction system receiving payment authorization from the user prior to a conclusion of an electronic auction to automatically loan funds at the conclusion of the election auction without receiving additional payment authorization from the user.  Id. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009107 Reexamination Control 95/001,590 Patent 7,627,528 B2   9 The Patent Owner\\u2019s arguments, however, are not persuasive.  Churchill discloses that prior to or during an auction, a user may configure automatic bidding setting, including setting a maximum bid.  Churchill 45:1-4 and 14-19.  When setting this maximum bid, a user may be prompted to select the credit feature, if the account is approved, when there are insufficient funds for the selected maximum bid.  See TPR Resp. Br. 10-11 (citing Churchill 45:42-56).  Thus, by selecting this credit feature in configuring the automatic bidding, the user provides authorization prior to the conclusion of the auction to automatically loan funds without any additional authorization at the conclusion of the auction.   Moreover, Churchill also describes that a user may use a credit-based accounts to make purchases (Churchill 1:13-17) and that a user can automate tasks such as \\u201clocate an auction, submit a bid, or finalize a sale.\\u201d Churchill 44:67-45:4.   As the Requestor identifies, \\u201cin the case where the buyer has a credit account, by automating sale finalization, the buyer is providing the system authorization to automatically loan funds to effect payment.\\u201d  TPR Resp. Br. 11. The Patent Owner also contends that Churchill teaches away from \\u201cany user interaction with respect to authorizing the automatic loaning of funds or points to effect payment\\u201d because Churchill teaches that the Yahoo! Auction System provides a credit marker in the user\\u2019s account.   This argument lacks merit because the Patent Owner fails to persuasively explain why providing an identifier indicating that the account holder is permitted to loan funds teaches away from a user providing authorization to automatically loan funds.  As discussed above, Churchill \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009107 Reexamination Control 95/001,590 Patent 7,627,528 B2   10 expressly describes that a user may be prompted with the option of loaning funds when a user is configuring the automatic bidder setting.  Churchill 45:1-4, 14-19 and 42-56.   Therefore, we see no error in the Examiner\\u2019s finding that Churchill discloses this limitation.  Accordingly, we affirm the rejection of claims 26 and 38 as anticipated by Churchill.    THE ANTICIPATION REJECTION OVER HUTCHISON Claims 26 and 38 (Group II) The Patent Owner argues that Hutchison fails to disclose \\u201creceiving payment authorization ... prior to a conclusion of an electronic auction ... to automatically loan funds thereto for effecting the at least one payment,\\u201d 3 and \\u201cloaning funds ... for automatically effecting the at least one payment following the conclusion of the electronic auction without receiving additional payment authorization from the user following the conclusion of the electronic auction,\\u201d as recited by claims 26 and 38.  PO App. Br. 14-17.   Hutchison discloses a payment system where a user can open a prepay or credit virtual payment account.  See PO App. Br. 14 (citing Hutchison Fig. 8A and 12:20-58).  The Patent Owner maintains that while in Hutchison funds are automatically deducted from a prepay account, funds are not                                            3 We apply the BPAI\\u2019s construction of \\u201cautomatically\\u201d from the appeal of the priority parent patent, U.S. Patent Nos. 7,483,856.  Namely, \\u201cautomatically\\u201d means \\u201cacting or operating in a manner essentially independent of external influence or control.\\u201d  See PO App Br. 14 and Related Proceedings App\\u2019x. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009107 Reexamination Control 95/001,590 Patent 7,627,528 B2   11 similarly automatically loaned to a credit account without additional manual authorization at the conclusion of the auction.  PO App. Br. 14-15. On the other hand, the Requestor points out that the Patent Owner relies on a single embodiment and \\u201cignores embodiments directed to an automatic electronic auction purchase.\\u201d  TPR Resp. Br. 4.  Further, the Requestor identifies that Hutchison discloses that the system \\u201csupports buyer-initiated, pre-approved purchases with expiration date/time, such as auction and gift-certificate purchases.\\u201d  TPR App. Br. 4-5 (citing Hutchison at 24:41-44).  In other words, Hutchison\\u2019s system allows a buyer, with a virtual credit account, to pre-approve a purchase for a length of time, e.g. during an auction, resulting in the automatic loaning of funds if the buyer wins the auction.   The Patent Owner fails to distinguish these teachings and further we agree that Hutchison\\u2019s disclosure of pre-approved purchases reads on the claimed limitation.  Therefore, we agree with the Examiner and Requestor that Hutchison discloses \\u201creceiving payment authorization ... prior to a conclusion of an electronic auction ... to automatically loan funds thereto for effecting the at least one payment.\\u201d  The Patent Owner additionally contends that Hutchison does not disclose loaning for automatically effecting without additional authorization following the conclusion of the auction.  PO App. Br. 15-16.  Here, the Patent Owner essentially argues that the payment is not effected until the user pays his/her bill.   There is no disclosure by Hutchison et al. that electronic payments for a buyer\\'s credit account are automatic following a purchase, e.g., following the conclusion of an electronic \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009107 Reexamination Control 95/001,590 Patent 7,627,528 B2   12 auction. See, e.g., Figure 10C which shows there is a \"Payment Due Date\" with respect to the \"Minimum Payment\" amount with respect to the buyer\\'s credit account. A \"Payment Due Date\" and a \"Minimum Payment\" are indications that the buyer is required to manually effect payment by the payment due date and make at least the minimum payment following a purchase, e.g., following the conclusion of an electronic auction.  PO App. Br. 16.     This argument, however, is misplaced.  Hutchison, in the cited paragraphs, identifies that the buyer must make payments to the buyer\\u2019s virtual credit account, i.e. the loaning entity, not the seller.  Thus, we agree with the Examiner and the Requestor that Hutchison discloses loaning for automatically effecting without additional authorization following the conclusion of the auction.    We therefore see no error in the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 26 and 33 are anticipated by Hutchison and accordingly affirm the rejection.    THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION OVER CHURCHILL AND HUTCHISON Claims 13, 26, 33 and 38 (Group I and II) The Patent Owner presents the same arguments here as those presented with respect to the Churchill and Hutchison anticipation rejections.  As discussed above, we disagree with the Patent Owner and see no error in the Examiner\\u2019s findings.   Accordingly, we affirm the rejection of claims 13, 26, 33, and 38 as unpatentable over Churchill and Hutchison.     \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009107 Reexamination Control 95/001,590 Patent 7,627,528 B2   13 THE OBVIOUSNESS REJECTION OVER HUTCHISON AND YOUNG Claims 26 and 38 (Group II) The Patent Owner again presents the same arguments as those discussed above with respect to Hutchison, which we find unpersuasive.  We likewise find the arguments regarding Young unavailing. First, the Patent Owner here asserts that the cited combination is improper.   Namely, according to the Patent Owner, the \\u2019528 Patent expressly addresses and remedies the disadvantages of charging a credit card, as taught by Young, to effect payment to a seller in an electronic auction.  PO App. Br. 35 (citing the Background section of the \\u2019528 Patent discussing disadvantages of using credit cards).  However, as the Requestor explains, the Examiner does not apply the use of a credit card but merely relies on Young for teaching loaning of funds without additional authorization.  TPR Resp. Br. 14; see also RAN 39.  The Patent Owner\\u2019s statements in the Specification that might be construed as possibly discouraging the use of a credit card are thus not relevant.  Moreover, the Patent Owner\\u2019s argument lacks merit because the disclosed embodiments of the \\u2019528 Patent expressly contemplate use of credit cards.  See \\u2019528 Patent 8:42-57.         Second, the Patent Owner\\u2019s contention that the cited combination would render Hutchison inoperable for its intended purpose is unpersuasive because they rely on a single embodiment of Hutchison.  As discussed above, Hutchison discloses use of pre-approving purchases, not just selecting a payment method after purchase.  See Hutchison 24:39-44.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009107 Reexamination Control 95/001,590 Patent 7,627,528 B2   14 Therefore, we see no error in the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 26 and 38 as unpatentable over Hutchison and Young and accordingly affirm the rejection.    DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s decision to reject claims 13, 26, 33, and 38 is affirmed.   Requests for extensions of time in this inter partes reexamination proceeding are governed by 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.956.  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.79.

EUBANKS ____________________  Appeal 2011-005028 Application 12/104,532 Technology Center 2600 ____________________   Before JOSEPH L. DIXON, JAMES R. HUGHES, and ERIC S. FRAHM, Administrative Patent Judges.  FRAHM, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-005028 Application 12/104,532  2  STATEMENT OF THE CASE Introduction Appellant appeals under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from a final rejection of claims 1-15, all the claims presently pending in the application.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We affirm the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejections of claims 1 and 5-15 and obviousness rejection of claims 3 and 4, and we reverse the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of claim 2. Appellant\\u2019s Disclosed Invention Appellant discloses a method and system for allowing a user/listener of a sound system to specify \\u201cdisliked\\u201d or \\u201cliked\\u201d audio/music content (Spec. \\xb6\\xb6 [0006]-[0009]; Abs.; Fig. 1).   Exemplary Claims An understanding of the invention can be derived from a reading of exemplary claims 1 and 2, which are reproduced below with emphases added:  1. A system, comprising:  a tuner for tuning to a radio station and for converting a signal  transmitted by the radio station to an audio signal;  a memory unit for storing one or more templates each derived from a  portion of a corresponding audio signal; and  a recognition processor, associated with the tuner and the memory  unit, for determining whether content of the audio signal matches one of the one or more templates, wherein if the content of the audio signal matches one of the one or more templates, the tuner is automatically tuned to a different radio station than the one to which the tuner is currently tuned.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-005028 Application 12/104,532  3  2. The system of claim l, wherein each of the one or more templates is associated with a content item for which a user of the system has previously indicated a dislike.  The Examiner\\u2019s Rejections (1) The Examiner rejected claims 1, 2, 5-8, and 15 under 35 U.S.C.             \\xa7 102(e) as being anticipated by Van Ryzin (US 6,011,854).  Ans. 3-6. (2) The Examiner rejected claims 9-14 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as being anticipated by Migliaccio (US 6,161,002).  Ans. 6-8. (3) The Examiner rejected claims 3 and 4 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Van Ryzin and Migliaccio.  Ans. 9. Issues on Appeal Based on Appellant\\u2019s arguments in the Appeal Brief (App. Br. 4-13) and the Reply Brief (Reply Br. 2-4), the following two issues are presented on appeal: (1) Did the Examiner err in rejecting claim 2 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) because Van Ryzin fails to disclose using \\u201ctemplates\\u201d that are \\u201cassociated with a content item for which a user of the system has previously indicated a dislike,\\u201d as recited in claim 2? (2) Did the Examiner err in rejecting (i) claims 1, 5-8, and 15 as being anticipated under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) by Van Ryzin, (ii) claims 9-14 as being anticipated under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) by Migliaccio, and (iii) claims 3 and 4 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Van Ryzin and Migliaccio, because Van Ryzin\\u2019s keywords and/or Migliaccio\\u2019s musical excerpts are not equivalent to the recited templates that are derived from a portion or content of an audio signal and used for matching?   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-005028 Application 12/104,532  4  ANALYSIS We have reviewed the Examiner\\u2019s rejections in light of Appellant\\u2019s contention in the Appeal Brief (App. Br. 4-13) and the Reply Brief (Reply Br. 2-4) that the Examiner has erred. Anticipation Rejection of Claim 2 Applying Van Ryzin We agree with Appellant\\u2019s conclusions (App. Br. 10; Reply Br. 3) with respect to the anticipation rejection of claim 2 with regard to Van Ryzin as applied by the Examiner (see Ans. 4 and 11).  Van Ryzin fails to teach or suggest templates that are associated with content which a user/listener has previously indicated a dislike.  And, we cannot agree with the Examiner that column 3, line 66 to column 4, line 5 inherently discloses such a feature.  In fact, the portion of columns 3 and 4 cited by the Examiner discloses just the opposite: a user inputs a keyword based on a type of report or update \\u201che or she wants to hear\\u201d (col. 4, l. 1) (emphasis added).  Thus, a user creates a template based on a like, and not a dislike as recited in claim 2.  Appellant\\u2019s contentions (App. Br. 10; Reply Br. 3) that Van Ryzin fails to teach templates that are associated with a dislike are persuasive.  Accordingly, we will not sustain the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of claims 2 based on Van Ryzin.  Anticipation Rejection of Claims 1, 5-8, and 15 Applying Van Ryzin However, with regard to the anticipation rejection of claims 1, 5-8, and 15 with regard to Van Ryzin, we agree with the Examiner\\u2019s conclusions that (i) Van Ryzin discloses matching audio signal content to a template, and changing a tuner when a match occurs, as recited in claims 1, 5-8, and 15 (Ans. 3-6).   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-005028 Application 12/104,532  5  \\u201c[T]he \\uf05bUS]PTO \\uf05bUnited States Patent and Trademark Office) must give claims their broadest reasonable construction consistent with the specification.\\u201d  In re Suitco Surface, Inc., 603 F.3d 1255, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting In re ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 496 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech Ctr., 367 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \\u201cTherefore, we look to the specification to see if it provides a definition for claim terms, but otherwise apply a broad interpretation.\\u201d  In re ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 496 F.3d at 1379.   Applying the broadest reasonable interpretation of the term in light of the Specification, we find the ordinary meaning for the phrase \\u201cderived from a portion of a corresponding audio signal\\u201d used to modify the term \\u201ctemplate\\u201d (see claims 1, 6, 7, and 15) to encompass Van Ryzin\\u2019s use of a keyword entered by a user to find a match for an audio signal corresponding to the keyword (see Van Ryzin, Fig. 2, steps 216 and 218; col. 3, l. 66 to col. 4, l. 5).  Because the operator of the system disclosed by Van Ryzin is free to input any type of keywords, the condition recited in independent claims 1, 6, 7, and 15, that the template (e.g., here the keyword) be \\u201cderived from a portion of a corresponding audio signal,\\u201d is met.  For example, if the operator inputs a keyword that represents a lyric in a song, then the keyword is derived from part of the song (i.e., audio signal).  In light of our claim interpretation supra, we are not persuaded by Appellant\\u2019s arguments (App. Br. 7-10) that Van Ryzin does not teach or suggest that keywords are derived from a corresponding audio signal, and are instead simply preselected by a user.  In view of the foregoing, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of claims 1, 5-8, and 15 based on Van Ryzin.  For similar reasons, \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-005028 Application 12/104,532  6  and because Appellant relies on the arguments presented for anticipation based on Van Ryzin in arguing for the patentability of claims 3 and 4 rejected for obviousness over the combination of Van Ryzin and Migliaccio, we will sustain the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of claims 1, 5-8, and 15 and obviousness rejection of claims 3 and 4. Anticipation Rejection of Claims 9-14 Applying Migliaccio With regard to the anticipation rejection of claims 9-14, we disagree with Appellant\\u2019s conclusions (see App. Br. 11-12).  We adopt as our own (1) the findings and reasons set forth by the Examiner in the action from which this appeal is taken (Ans. 6-8), and (2) the reasons set forth by the Examiner in the Examiner\\u2019s Answer (Ans. 11-12) in response to Appellant\\u2019s Appeal Brief.  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that Migliaccio discloses matching musical excerpts that is equivalent to the recited matching of \\u201caudio signal\\u201d content with \\u201ctemplates\\u201d as recited in claims 9-14 (Ans. 6-8), and highlight and emphasize certain findings with regard to Migliaccio as follows. Migliaccio\\u2019s Figure 2 shows step S5 which is disclosed as starting a search procedure based on a user\\u2019s request to compare musical excerpts stored in memory unit 10 with excerpts broadcast within the searched-through frequency spectrum (col. 4, ll. 31-35).  Therefore, Appellant\\u2019s contentions (App. Br. 11-12), that (i) Migliaccio\\u2019s musical excerpts are derived from alphanumeric data transmitted to a subcarrier, and (ii) Migliaccio does not compare anything to an audio signal, are unpersuasive.  A musical excerpt such as that disclosed by Migliaccio is encompassed by the recited \\u201ccontent of the audio signal\\u201d in claims 9 and 14. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-005028 Application 12/104,532  7  In view of the foregoing, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of claims 9-14 based on Migliaccio. Obviousness Rejection of Claims 3 and 4  With regard to the obviousness rejection of claims 3 and 4 over the combination of Van Ryzin and Migliaccio, Appellant argues (App. Br. 12) that claims 3 and 4 incorporate all of the elements and limitations of claim 1, and Migliaccio fails to cure the deficiencies of Van Ryzin as applied to claim 1.  Because we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of claim 1 based on Van Ryzin as discussed supra, Appellant\\u2019s arguments regarding the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection of claims 3 and 4 (see Ans. 9) based on Van Ryzin\\u2019s anticipation of claim 1 are not persuasive that the Examiner erred in rejecting claims 3 and 4 over the combination of Van Ryzin and Migliaccio.  Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection of claims 3 and 4 over the combination of Van Ryzin and Migliaccio.  CONCLUSIONS (1) Appellant has established that the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 2 as being anticipated under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) by Van Ryzin because Van Ryzin fails to disclose using \\u201ctemplates\\u201d that are \\u201cassociated with a content item for which a user of the system has previously indicated a dislike,\\u201d as recited in claim 2. (2) The Examiner did not err in rejecting (i) claims 1, 5-8, and 15 as being anticipated under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) by Van Ryzin, (ii) claims 9-14 as being anticipated under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) by Migliaccio, and (iii) claims 3 and 4 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Van Ryzin and Migliaccio. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-005028 Application 12/104,532  8  DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of claim 2 is reversed, and the anticipation rejections of claims 1 and 5-15 and the obviousness rejection of claims 3 and 4 are affirmed.   No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iv).  AFFIRMED-IN-PART    Vsh  \\x0c'},\n",

SCHEINER, JOHN A. EVANS, and SUSAN L. C. MITCHELL, Administrative Patent Judges.  EVANS, Administrative Patent Judge.  DECISION ON APPEAL  This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) involving claims to methods of correlating a patient\\u2019s biological profile information and treatment efficacy information.  The Examiner has rejected the claims as obvious.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We affirm.   Rather than reiterate the arguments of Appellant and the Examiner,                                            1 The record includes a transcript of the Oral Hearing held October 15, 2013. 2 The Real Party in Interest is the inventor, Nien Wei (App. Br. 6). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   2 we refer to the Appeal Brief (filed Dec. 20, 2010), the Answer (mailed Mar. 30, 2011), and the Reply Brief (filed May 31, 2011).  We have considered in this decision only those arguments Appellant  raised in the Briefs.  Any other arguments which Appellant could have made but chose not to make in the Briefs are deemed to be waived.  See 37 C.F.R.  \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(iv).  STATEMENT OF THE CASE The claims relate to methods, systems, and computer program products that predict an individual\\u2019s treatment outcome from a sampling of a group of patients\\u2019 biological profiles. Claims 1, 4, 5, 7-9, 13-15, 17-27, 29-35, 38, 40-44, 49-55, 60, 68, 70-74, 76, 78, 82, 85, 86, and 88-94 are on appeal. Claims 1 and 79 are independent. Claims 2, 3, 6, 10-12, 16, 28, 36, 37, 39, 45-48, 56-59, 61-67, 69, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, and 87 are withdrawn or canceled.  (App. Br. 6).  An understanding of the invention can be derived from a reading of exemplary claim 1, which is reproduced below: 1. A method of correlating between patient biological profile information and treatment efficacy information, comprising:  identifying a group of patients who had a medical condition and who underwent a particular treatment for the medical condition;  receiving multiple gene based pre-treatment biological profile information obtained through analysis of one or more of tissue and biological specimens obtained from the group of \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   3 patients prior to the group of patients receiving the particular treatment for the medical condition;  receiving post-treatment efficacy information indicative of an impact of the particular treatment on the medical condition, wherein the efficacy information is obtained from the group of patients following the particular treatment;  performing a discriminant analysis-based pattern recognition process on the multiple gene based pre-treatment biological profile information and the post-treatment efficacy information, including identifying discriminating features of the multiple gene based pretreatment biological profile information that correlate to different post-treatment efficacies, and including generating a prediction model for the particular treatment that maps the multiple gene based pre-treatment biological profile information, using the discriminating features, to the corresponding different post-treatment efficacies;  receiving multiple gene based pre-treatment biological profile information obtained through analysis of the one or more of tissue and biological specimens obtained from a new patient prior to the new patient receiving the particular treatment for the medical condition; and  processing the new patient multiple gene based pre-treatment biological profile information according to the model, including using the discriminating features of the new patient multiple gene based pre-treatment biological profile information to predict an efficacy of the particular treatment for the new patient prior to the new patient receiving the particular treatment;  wherein the multiple gene based pre-treatment biologic profile information and the post-treatment efficacy information are received within a suitably programmed computer system, and wherein the discriminant analysis-based pattern recognition \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   4 process is performed within the suitably programmed computer system.

Claim Groupings Based on Appellant\\u2019s arguments in the Appeal Brief, we will decide the appeal on the basis of claims as set forth below.  See 37 C.F.R.  \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii).  Because Appellant did not address Rejections 2-4 or 5-7 set forth above, any additional arguments that Appellant could have made concerning these rejections are waived.  See 37 C.F.R.  \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(iv).  Therefore, we will not separately address these rejections here.  CLAIMS 1, 4, 7-9, 14-15, 17-19, 23, 29-33, 35, 38, 53-55, 60,  71-72, 74, 76, 78, 85-86, AND 91-93 Issues and Analysis Argument 1. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cto predict an efficacy of the particular treatment for the new patient prior to the new patient receiving the particular treatment,\\u201d as recited in claim 1. Appellant contends that each of Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar discloses \\u201cprognosis,\\u201d but not \\u201ctreatment efficacy,\\u201d as claimed. (App. Br. 21).  Appellant contends that: \\u201ca prognosis                                                                                                                               Proliferation of Human Colon Cancer, 55 CANCER RESEARCH 3964-3968 (1995).  15 Kam, US 2003/0158829 A1, pub. Aug. 21, 2003, filed Nov. 26, 2002. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   7 is an estimate of a likely outcome or progression of a medical condition, based on a present state of the medical condition and historical observations of other patients who had the medical condition,\\u201d whereas a treatment efficacy prediction \\u201cis a determination of a likely impact of a particular treatment on a medical condition of a specific patient.\\u201d  Thus, Appellant contends that \\u201c[t]reatment efficacy prediction is treatment-specific or treatment-dependent,\\u201d but prognosis is not. (App. Br. 9-10).  The Examiner adopts Appellant\\u2019s definition of prognosis as \\u201ca determination of a likely outcome in view of an expected progression of a medical condition\\u201d and adopts Appellant\\u2019s statement that \\u201ca prognosis is a prediction of outcome of a medical condition.\\u201d (Ans. 32-33)(citing App. Br. 9).  In view of Appellant\\u2019s definitions, the Examiner finds that because patients may be treated for medical conditions by monitoring a patient, in the absence of surgery or medication, to see whether the condition resolves of its own accord, a prognosis of a medical condition necessarily involves predicting an efficacy or outcome of a treatment.  (Ans. 32).  Based on Appellant\\u2019s statement that \\u201ca prognosis may be made as to life expectancy, survival time, or potential for recurrence, based on a possibility of, or an extent of micro metastases,\\u201d (App. Br. 9) the Examiner finds that Singh predicts treatment efficacies of prostate cancer in patients based on recurrence of prostate cancer in other patients after surgery.  The Examiner finds, in view of Appellant\\u2019s own logic and definitions, the prognoses for \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   8 prostate cancer, given in Singh, involve predicting surgical treatment efficacies. (Ans. 33).  Appellant cites the title of a section of a publication by Tuma16 as reinforcing the alleged distinction between \\u201cprognosis\\u201d and \\u201ctreatment efficacy\\u201d: \\u201cMove to Use Genomic Data for Treatment Selection Has Been Slower than For Prognosis.\\u201d (App. Br. 46). On its face, Tuma relates to \\u201ctreatment selection,\\u201d but not to \\u201ctreatment efficacy.\\u201d As the Examiner found, Tuma does not teach \\u201cthat the reason for this alleged gap between treatment selection and prognosis [which encompasses treatment efficacy] is due to lack of data pertaining to treatment efficacy . . . .\\u201d  (Ans. 39). In view of Appellant\\u2019s definitions, we are not persuaded of Examiner error.  We agree with the Examiner that \\u201ca prognosis necessarily encompasses a treatment efficacy.\\u201d  (Ans. 35, 39, 40, 47). Argument 2. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201creceiving multiple gene based pre-treatment biological profile information ... from the group of patients prior to the group of patients receiving the particular treatment for the medical condition,\\u201d as recited in claim 1. (App. Br. 27).  The Examiner finds that Singh does not explicitly state that the patient biopsy samples were taken prior to surgery.  The Examiner finds that                                            16 R. S.Tuma, Using Molecular Information for Prognosis and Treatment, AACR Annual Meeting, 29 ONCOLOGY TIMES (May 25, 2007).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   9 Polissar teaches a \\u201ctwo-step\\u201d biopsy where samples are taken prior to surgery and a \\u201cone-step\\u201d procedure where samples are taken during surgery. (Ans. 8). We are not persuaded of Examiner error. Argument 3. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201creceiving post-treatment efficacy information indicative of an impact of the particular treatment on the medical condition, wherein the efficacy information is obtained from the group of patients following the particular treatment,\\u201d as recited in claim 1.  Appellant contends that surgery is not a \\u201ctreatment\\u201d for micrometastasis, therefore, \\u201cit makes no sense to refer to efficacy of surgery for micrometastasis.\\u201d (App. Br. 28). The Examiner finds that Singh discloses that \\u201ca model using gene expression data alone accurately predicted patient outcome following prostatectomy.\\u201d (Ans. 6).  The Examiner also found that because Appellant presented no limiting definition of a \\u201cparticular treatment\\u201d in the Specification, \\u201csurgery is interpreted to be a form [of] treatment designed to particularly eliminate tumors from patients.\\u201d  (Ans. 33). Appellant has presented no authority or evidence in support of the contention that surgery is not a treatment for micrometastasis.  Attorney argument is not evidence. In re Pearson, 494 F.2d 1399, 1405 (CCPA 1974). Nor can it take the place of evidence lacking in the record.  Meitzner v. Mindick, 549 F.2d 775, 782 (CCPA 1977).  Lawyer\\u2019s arguments and \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   10 conclusory statements, which are unsupported by factual evidence, are entitled to little probative value.  In re Geisler, 116 F.3d 1465, 1470 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  We are, thus, not persuaded that the Examiner has erred in finding that Singh teaches \\u201creceiving post-treatment efficacy information indicative of an impact of the particular treatment on the medical condition,\\u201d as recited in claim 1. Argument 4.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cperforming a discriminant analysis-based pattern recognition process on the multiple gene based pre-treatment biological profile information and the post-treatment efficacy information,\\u201d as recited in claim 1.  Appellant contends that the Examiner \\u201cconcedes that Singh does not teach receiving pre-treatment information, thus, cannot teach a discriminant analysis based thereon. (App. Br. 29). While the Examiner notes that Singh only states the biopsy samples were taken from patients \\u201cundergoing\\u201d surgery and does not explicitly state that the biopsy samples taken from the patients were taken before the prostatetectomy (Ans. 7), the Examiner finds that portions of Singh disclose \\u201cGene ranking, class prediction by k-nearest neighbors, and permutation testing for dichotomous variables,\\u201d and \\u201cCorrelation of gene expression with continuous variables.\\u201d  The Examiner finds that these sections teach discriminant analyses. (Ans. 34).  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s characterization of the Examiner\\u2019s findings regarding the teachings of Singh.  Moreover, Appellant has not \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   11 argued, with specificity, why the cited disclosure does not teach discriminant analysis, as found by the Examiner.  We, therefore, are not persuaded that the Examiner has erred. Argument 5.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201creceiving multiple gene based pre-treatment biological profile information ... from a new patient prior to the new patient receiving the particular treatment for the medical condition,\\u201d as recited in claim 1.  Appellant contends that Singh does not teach receiving a tissue sample from any patient other than the 21 used to train the model and contends that the Examiner concedes that Singh does not teach receiving tissue samples from a patient prior to surgery. (App. Br. 30). The Examiner finds, contrary to Appellant\\u2019s contention, that Singh teaches a validation algorithm wherein a new patient is assigned a treatment outcome on the basis of a comparison of the patient\\u2019s existing pretreatment genetic data and the pre- and post-treatment data of the other individuals. The Examiner further finds that Polissar teaches a pre-surgical treatment biopsies yield genetic data that predict a treatment efficacy. (Ans. 34).  We are not persuaded of Examiner error. Argument 6.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cpredict[ing] an efficacy of the particular treatment for the new patient prior to the new patient receiving the particular treatment,\\u201d as recited in claim 1.  Appellant contends that Singh specifically teaches away from applying the preliminary model to clinical care.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   12 Appellant cites Singh as teaching \\u201cthis is a preliminary model and larger datasets will be required to reach model stability,\\u201d and \\u201cconfirmatory studies will be required prior to the implementation of any changes in the clinical care of patients with prostate cancer.\\u201d (App. Br. 31). The Examiner finds that Singh teaches that \\u201ca model using gene expression data alone accurately predicted patient outcome following prostatectomy.  These results support the notion that the clinical behavior is linked to underlying gene expression differences that are detectable at the time of diagnosis.\\u201d (Ans. 6).  We adopt these findings of the Examiner and we further find that Singh\\u2019s teaching that a specific model may be improved does not \\u201cteach away\\u201d from the concept of using models to predict treatment outcomes. Argument 7.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest that the discriminant-analysis model be performed on a computer.  Appellant contends that Wolberg does not complete the teachings alleged to be missing from Singh. (App. Br. 32). Appellant contends that Wolberg relates to computerized diagnosis and prognosis, but not to treatment efficacy. (App. Br. 35). The Examiner finds that Wolberg discloses studies related to computerized breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  (Ans. 8).  As discussed above, in view of Appellant\\u2019s own definitions, we do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s proposed distinction between prognosis and treatment efficacy.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   13 As we have previously stated, we agree with the Examiner that a prognosis necessarily encompasses a treatment efficacy. Argument 8.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contentions related to comparisons between treated and untreated patients.  Appellant contends that Singh does not teach a dependency or causal relationship between prostatectomy and patient survival or recurrence. (App. Br. 32).  We agree with the Examiner that this argument is not persuasive \\u201cbecause the biopsies (which may be obtained before or during surgery . . . ) give genetic data that predict a treatment efficacy and prognosis; potentially before the radical prostatectomy.\\u201d  (Ans. 35; Singh 203 (stating in abstract that \\u201ca model using gene expression data alone accurately predicted patient outcome following prostatectomy\\u201d)).  Argument 9.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cefficacy information indicative of an impact of the particular treatment on the medical condition,\\u201d as recited in claim 1.  As we have previously found, Singh specifically teaches that \\u201ca model using gene expression data alone accurately predicted patient outcome following prostatectomy.  These results support the notion that the clinical behavior is linked to underlying gene expression differences that are detectable at the time of diagnosis.\\u201d (Ans. 6).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   14  Argument 10.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the combination of Singh, Polissar, and Wolberg leads to unpredictable results. Appellant contends that Singh is directed to prostate cancer, whereas Wolberg and Polissar are directed to breast cancer and that there is no \\u201cteaching or suggestion,\\u201d in the cited art, that the breast cancer prognosis techniques of Wolberg and Polissar, could be combined with the prostate cancer prognosis techniques of Singh, with any suitable degree of predictability (App. Br. 44). We adopt the Examiner\\u2019s finding (Ans. 14) that a person of skill in the oncology arts would have a reasonable expectation of success in combining Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar because each reference relates to the analysis, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer in the body. Argument 11.  Finally, Appellant asserts that the long felt, but unmet, need for the personalized medicine technique recited in claim 1 indicated nonobviousness.  (App. Br. 45-49).  Appellant asserts that \\u201cTuma, Pusztai, and FDA, thus clearly demonstrate that even years after the filing date of the present application, no techniques are currently available to help physicians identify suitable particular therapies or treatments for individual patients based on genomic information of the patent, such as recited in claim 1.\\u201d  (App. Br. 47).  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that there exists a long felt, but unmet need for \\u201cpersonalized medicine.\\u201d First, we agree with the Examiner that the long felt need as articulated by Appellant is based on differentiating between prognosis and treatment \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   15 efficacy.  (Ans. 40.)  As we have previously stated, we agree with the Examiner that prognosis encompasses efficacy; they are not mutually exclusive concepts.   We also agree with the Examiner\\u2019s finding that that these three articles teach \\u201cthat there is a need to optimize treatment selection (even treatment selection using genomic data) to personalize medicine for a patient\\u201d (Ans. 39), but  Appellant\\u2019s arguments are not persuasive because there is a difference between treatment selection and treatment efficacy.  Although Tuma is the only document of the three (cited by Appellant) to suggest that more data is available for treatment selection than for prognosis (i.e., treatment efficacy), the documents do not meet the burden [MPEP 716.02(b)] of teaching that the reason for this alleged gap between treatment selection and prognosis is due to lack of data pertaining to treatment efficacy.  The abundance of treatment selection data may be due to other factors, such as there may be more data relating to adverse side effects of a treatment compared to the amount of data relating to prognosis and treatment efficacies. (Ans. 39). Moreover, Appellant\\u2019s arguments relating to \\u201cpersonalized medicine\\u201d are not commensurate in scope with the claims which relate to a \\u201cmethod of correlating between patient biological profile information and treatment efficacy information.\\u201d  In re Dill, 604 F.2d 1356, 1361 (CCPA 1979) (\\u201cThe evidence presented to rebut a prima facie case of obviousness must be commensurate in scope with the claims to which it pertains.\\u201d). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   16 Appellant argues claims 7-9, 14-15, 17-19, 23, 29-33, 35, 53-55, 60, 71, 78, and 85-86 as a group, which we have addressed above, and separately argues claims 4, 38, 72, 74, 76, and 91-93. (App. Br. 50).  We address the separately argued claims below. Claim 4.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cgenerating the model to predict the efficacy of the particular treatment on a scale,\\u201d as recited in claim 4.  Appellant contends that Singh compares the output of a model to actual patient survival information, but does not predict the efficacy of surgery. (App. Br. 51). The Examiner finds that Singh, Figure 2B, discloses a scale on the ordinate axis of fraction of patients remaining disease-free as a function of time. (Ans. 40). Contrary to Appellant\\u2019s contentions, Singh relates to the efficacy of surgery.  Singh, Figure 2B, discloses that \\u201cKaplan-meir [sic] analysis was used to plot the fraction of at-risk patients remaining free of disease (y axis) at the indicated time after prostatectomy (x axis).\\u201d  We are not persuaded that the Examiner has erred. Claim 38.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cto predict efficacy of a first line treatment for a cancer patient,\\u201d as recited in claim 38.  Appellant contends that the prostatectomy of Singh is not a \\u201cfirst line\\u201d treatment, as defined in the Specification:  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   17 [S]ome of the ovarian cancer patients used Topoisomerase 1 inhibitor-based (e.g., Irinotean or Topotecan) chemotherapeutic drugs after a relapse from the platinum-based treatment as a second line treatment.  (App. Br. 51-52).  During examination, claim terms are to be given their broadest reasonable interpretation as they would have been understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, taking into account whatever enlightenment may be provided by the Specification.  In re Morris, 127 F.3d 1048, 1054 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  To be his own lexicographer, a patentee must use a \\u201cspecial definition of the term [that] is clearly stated in the patent specification or file history.\\u201d Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996); see also CCS Fitness, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp., 288 F.3d 1359, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\\u201c[T]he claim term will not receive its ordinary meaning if the patentee acted as his own lexicographer and clearly set forth a definition of the disputed claim term in either the specification or prosecution history.\\u201d).  Appellant contends that the Examiner improperly fails to credit the definition of \\u201cfirst line\\u201d proffered in the Specification at paragraph 113.  We do not agree.  As found by the Examiner (Ans. 40), Appellant\\u2019s proffer suggests that Topoisomerase-1 inhibitors are examples of a \\u201csecond line\\u201d treatment, but the proffer in no way defines what is a first line treatment. Appellant further proffers a definition from Wikipedia: \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   18 A first-line treatment or first-line therapy is a medical therapy recommended for initial treatment of a disease, sign or symptom, usually on the basis of empirical evidence for its efficacy.  (App. Br. 52)(citing Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment).  However, nothing in the Wikipedia definition excludes surgery as a first line treatment.  Claim 72.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest using \\u201ca plurality of different types of discriminant analysis-based pattern recognition processes,\\u201d and \\u201cselecting the model that most accurately predicts ....,\\u201d as recited in claim 72. (App. Br. 56).  The Examiner finds that Singh, Figure 2B, discloses the results of testing samples using four types of discriminant analysis:  5-gene model, Gleason Score, Serum PSA, and Combined Risk.  The Examiner finds that Wolberg strengthens this teaching by using testing/training subsets for prognostic purposes.  Appellant admits that Wolberg teaches Recurrent Surface Approximation. (App. Br. 58).  The Examiner further finds that Singh and Wolberg are combinable with a reasonable expectation of success because Singh (p. 206, col. 2) discloses a validation study for the 5-gene model that is similar to the testing/training study of Wolberg, Figure 1.  (Ans. 41).  We agree with the Examiner. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   19  Claim 74.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cwherein the multiple gene based pretreatment biological profile information is obtained from targeted tissue samples,\\u201d as recited in claim 74.  Appellant contends that the Examiner concedes that neither Singh nor Wolberg teach obtaining multiple gene-based pre-treatment biological profile information. (App. Br. 62).  The Examiner finds the combination of Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar make obvious the use of multiple gene based pre-treatment biological profile information.  Singh teaches the biological data is obtained from prostate tissue.  (Ans. 42)(incorporating by reference Ans. 6-12).  We agree with the Examiner.  Claim 76.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cselecting a mode of treatment for the new patient based on the predicted treatment efficacy,\\u201d as recited in claim 76. Appellant contends that Singh does not teach or suggest selecting prostatectomy in response to a prediction of recurrence of the 5-gene model. In addition, Appellant contends that Singh discloses that \\u201clarger, confirmatory studies will be required prior to the implementation of any changes in the clinical care of patients with prostate cancer,\\u201d thus, teaching away from applying the preliminary findings to new patients. (App. Br. 63).  The Examiner finds that Singh discloses that prostatectomy is chosen as a treatment modality because it is known that 70% of prostate cancer patients are cured by surgery alone. (Ans. 12, 42).  We agree. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   20  Claims 91-93.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cclassification\\u201d of \\u201csensitivity,\\u201d as variously recited in claims 91-93.  Appellant contends that \\u201csensitivity\\u201d is a measure of a patient\\u2019s responsiveness to treatment, as defined in the Specification at paragraphs 6 and 7.  Appellant contends that recurrence is not equivalent to sensitivity. (App. Br. 64-65).  The Examiner finds that Singh, Figure 2B, teaches sensitivity by plotting the fraction of patients remaining free of prostate cancer as a function of time as a result of removal of a diseased prostate. (Ans. 42-43). We agree with the Examiner.  CLAIMS 5, 34, 40-44, 68, 88-90, AND 94 ISSUES AND ANALYSIS Appellant advances three contentions regarding the addition of Abrams to the combination of Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar:  first, Appellant contends that whereas the Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar studies relate to individuals, Abrams studies groups of patients; second, Appellant contends that the Abrams chemotherapy is not analogous to the surgical treatments of Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar;  third, Appellant contends that the groups studied by Abrams are not used to predict the treatment efficacies of new patients.  Therefore, there would not be a reasonable expectation of success in combining Abrams with Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar. (App. Br. 67-68). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   21 The Examiner finds that these arguments are not persuasive for several reasons:  first, although Abrams focuses on groups, in order to obtain accurate statistics, the disease status of each individual in the group is analyzed and recorded; second, the statistical analyses of Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar are general to any treatment, and the discriminant analysis functions independently of treatment type (i.e. surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation); third, as the statistical methods of Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar function independently of treatment type, as would their validation and/or training/testing set algorithms. (Ans. 44-45).  We agree with the Examiner. Claim 5. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cpredicting efficacy of multiple particular treatments for a new patient, prior to the new patient receiving any of the particular treatments,\\u201d as recited in claim 5.  Appellant contends that Abrams teaches administering a sequence of three treatment regimens to three groups of patients.  Thus, the study compares averaged results among these three groups, not an individual patient in each group. (App. Br. 69).  The Examiner finds that Abrams focuses on groups in order to obtain accurate statistics for analysis, but that the disease status of each individual must be monitored.  The Examiner further finds that the rejection is over the combination including Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar which presents studies that focus on individuals. (Ans. 43).  We agree with the Examiner. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   22  Claim 34. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cwherein the treatment comprises a drug based treatment.\\u201d  Appellant contends that Abrams teaches three treatment sequences comprising chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy, followed by an additional drug therapy, but that Abrams does not teach analyzing the results of any particular facet of the treatment regime. Appellant further contends that the prostatectomy of Singh and the treatment regimes of Abrams are so different that their analysis cannot be combined. (App. Br. 70-71).  The Examiner finds that the Statistical analysis of Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar are general to any treatment and that the discriminant analysis functions independent of treatment type (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy). (Ans. 43). We agree with the Examiner.  Claim 40. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cusing the model to predict efficacy of a single drug treatment.\\u201d  Appellant contends that Abrams teaches drug therapy combined with radiotherapy.  Appellant contends that because Abrams does not differentiate the effects of the drug from those of the radiation, there is no way to combine the statistical methods of the remaining references to determine the effects of the single drug. (App. Br. 72).  The Examiner finds that the referenced statistical methods and their associated training algorithms are general to any treatment modality, including a single-drug modality. (Ans. 44).  We agree. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   23  Claim 41. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cusing the model to predict efficacy of a multiple drug treatment for the medical condition,\\u201d as recited in claim 41. Appellant contends that Abrams recites \\u201cmultiple lines of drugs\\u201d which is not a term of art, nor is it a term understood by persons of skill in the art. Appellant contends that Abrams is not predictably combinable with Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar. (App. Br. 73).  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s finding that that \\u201cmultiple lines of drugs\\u201d would be understood as treatment by several drugs, thus meeting the claim language \\u201cmultiple drug treatment.\\u201d (Ans. 44-45). The contentions relating to the combinability of the references have been addressed above.   Claims 42-44.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cusing the model to predict efficacy of a first line single drug treatment.\\u201d (App. Br. 73-75).  The Examiner finds that Appellant reiterates the arguments above regarding a specific meaning for \\u201cline of treatment\\u201d that is exemplified in paragraph 113 of the Specification, but never defined.  Absent a special definition of \\u201clines of treatment\\u201d explicitly set forth in the Specification, the Examiner gives the term its broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the Specification.  In this instance, Treatment A is interpreted to a first line multiple drug treatment because it is the first treatment in the sequence (A, B, and C) that uses multiple drugs.  Likewise, Treatment B is interpreted to a first line single drug treatment because it is the first treatment in the \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   24 sequence (A, B, and C) that uses a single drug.  Treatment A is the first treatment.  Treatment B is a later line treatment to Treatment A.  Treatment C is later line to both Treatments A and B.  (Ans. 45-46).  We agree with the Examiner. Claim 88.  We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cwherein the efficacy information includes cell response information associated with tissue to which the particular treatment is targeted,\\u201d as recited in claim 88.  Appellant contends that Abrams\\u2019 assessment of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in blood is not combinable with Singh\\u2019s teachings related to prostatectomy because it is not \\u201ccell response information associated with tissue to which the particular treatment is targeted\\u201d because the AFP is not derived from the primary tissue (i.e., the removed prostate).  (App. Br. 76).  The Examiner finds that claim 88 recites that the cell response information is associated with the tissue (in this instance, prostate tissue); claim 88 does not recite that this data is derived from the actual tissue.  Thus, the measurement of AFP is associated with the cell response information (cancer or healthy) of the prostate tissue.  (Ans. 46).  Because Appellant\\u2019s arguments are based on an improperly narrow reading of the claim, we are not persuaded that the Examiner has erred. Claim 89. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cwherein the efficacy information includes tissue scan information.\\u201d  Appellant contends that Wolberg teaches \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   25 assessment of primary tissue, but that claim 89 requires assessment of the metastatic tissue. (App. Br. 77).  Claim 89 does not so narrowly define \\u201ctissue.\\u201d  Because Appellant\\u2019s arguments are not commensurate in scope with the claim, we are not persuaded that the Examiner has erred. Claim 90. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cwherein the efficacy information includes blood information.\\u201d  Appellant contends that the Examiner\\u2019s citation of Abrams\\u2019 teaching assessment alpha-fetoprotein produced in the blood is inapt because Abrams does not address the treatment efficacy of an individual patient. (App. Br. 77).  We find these contentions unavailing because we agree with the Examiner\\u2019s findings, as discussed above, that the combination of Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar addresses the treatment efficacy of an individual patient. Claim 94. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cwherein the treatment includes non-surgical treatment.\\u201d  Appellant concedes Abrams teaches drug (non-surgical) therapy, but contend that it is unclear how Abrams may be combined with Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar to form a model to predict the efficacy of non-surgical treatments.  (App. Br. 78).  The combination of Singh, Wolberg, and Polissar to form a model to predict the efficacy of non-surgical treatments was discussed above.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   26 REJECTION 8: CLAIM 49  Claim 49. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest \\u201cto predict efficacy of the same particular treatment for a second medical condition.\\u201d  Appellant contends that the Examiner\\u2019s citation of Barnhill suggests a misinterpretation of claim 49 as re-training the model of claim 1.  Appellant contends that the model of claim 1 is not re-trained, rather it is used \\u201cas is\\u201d to predict the efficacy of the same treatment for a second medical condition. (App. Br. 79-80). The Examiner notes, and we agree, that the features upon which Appellant\\u2019s arguments rely (i.e., that the parameters for the discriminant model for each of the plurality of medical conditions must be the same) are not recited in the rejected claim.  (Ans. 47).  Although the claims are interpreted in light of the Specification, limitations from the Specification are not read into the claims.  See In re Van Geuns, 988 F.2d 1181 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  REJECTIONS 9 AND 10 CLAIMS: 50-52  Claims 50-52. Appellant contends that the model is trained to predict efficacy of a particular treatment for colon cancer, and is used to predict efficacy of the same treatment for ovarian cancer in a new patient. (App. Br. 82-85). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   27  However, we agree with the Examiner\\u2019s findings (Ans. 27-28) that study of a first type of cancer to generate a predictive model for that cancer would suggest study of a second type of cancer to generate a predictive model for the second cancer.  REJECTION 11: CLAIM 73  Claim 73. We do not agree with Appellant\\u2019s contention that the cited art does not teach or suggest using \\u201ca plurality of different types of discriminant analysis-based pattern recognition processes.\\u201d  Appellant contends that Kam does not teach the repeated testing of a model with multiple sub-sets of test cases and averaging the models. (App. Br. 87-89). We are not persuaded of error because the Examiner finds that Wolberg (not Kam) is relied upon to teach averaging iterative testing/training results. (Ans. 50).  ORDER The rejection of claims 1, 4, 5, 7-9, 13-15, 17-27, 29-35, 38, 40-44, 49-55, 60, 68, 70-74, 76, 78, 82, 85, 86, and 88-94  under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 103 is AFFIRMED.     \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005375 Application 10/394,137   28 TIME PERIOD FOR RESPONSE No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a).

MORGAN, and  JUSTIN BUSCH, Administrative Patent Judges.  MANTIS MERCADER, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL          \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004784 Application 11/505,190   2STATEMENT OF THE CASE Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from a final rejection of claims 1-29 and 31-33.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b). We affirm-in-part.  THE INVENTION Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention is directed to receiving unit 28 that includes a tuner circuit board 104 receiving a satellite signal.  The tuner circuit board 104 demodulates and decodes the satellite signal to form a second signal.  The second signal is provided to a processor board 112 that is separated from the tuner and formats the second signal to form an audio signal and a video signal.  An integrated bus 100 couples the tuner circuit board 104 and the processor circuit board 112.  Abstract. Independent claim 1, reproduced below, is representative of the subject matter on appeal. 1.  A receiving unit comprising: a tuner board receiving a satellite signal, said tuner board tuning, demodulating and decoding the satellite signal to form a second signal; a processor board separated from the tuner board receiving the second signal and formatting the second signal to form an audio signal and a video signal; and an integrated bus coupling the tuner board and the processor board, said integrated bus communicating the second signal, the audio signal and the video signal.      \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004784 Application 11/505,190   3REFERENCES and REJECTIONS 1. The Examiner rejected claims 1-5, 7-9, 12-15, 19-29, and 31 under   35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by Ju (US Pub. 2002/0008779 A1; published Jan. 24, 2002).  Ans. 3-8. 2. The Examiner rejected claim 6 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Ju in view of McMiller (US 7,109,831 B2; issued Sept. 19, 2006, filed May 25, 2004).  Ans. 8-9. 3. The Examiner rejected claims 10, 11, and 16-18 under 35 U.S.C.        \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Ju and Jung (US Pub. 2004/0085479 A1; published May 6, 2004).  Ans. 9-10. 4. The Examiner rejected claim 32 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Ju in view of Barton (US Pub. 2003/0026589 A1; published Feb. 6, 2003).  Ans. 10-13. 5. The Examiner rejected claim 33 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Ju, Barton, and further in view of Brown            (US 5,854,904; issued Dec. 29, 1998).  Ans. 13-14.      ISSUES  The pivotal issues are whether the Examiner erred in finding that: 1. Ju teaches \\u201ca tuner board receiving a satellite signal, said tuner board tuning, demodulating and decoding the satellite signal to form a second signal\\u201d as recited in claim 1; and  2.  Ju anticipates the limitation of \\u201cconditional access circuit is disposed on a conditional access board separated from the tuner board and the processor board\\u201d as recited in claim 3.    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004784 Application 11/505,190   4ANALYSIS Claims 1, 2, 7, 9, and 12-14 Appellants argue that Ju does not teach \\u201ca tuner board receiving a satellite signal, said tuner board tuning, demodulating and decoding the satellite signal to form a second signal\\u201d as recited in claim 1 (see App. Br. 9-10).  In particular, Appellants argue that Ju\\u2019s Figures 4A and 4B are directed to a cable rather than a satellite signal (App. Br. 9).  Appellants further argue that Ju\\u2019s Figures 6A and 6B are directed to a satellite signal but not a tuner board (App. Br. 9).   We do not agree.  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s findings that Ju (Figs. 1-3, \\xb6 [0041]) teaches a modular television system with a base module 100 and function-extending module 200, wherein the function-extending module 200 comprises multiple extended modular boards or modules and one of which is a broadcast/receiving module 210 as illustrated in Figures 5A-B (\\xb6\\xb6 [0054]-[0055]; Ans. 15).  The broadcast/receiving module 210 comprises a switch 213 and a tuner 214 for selecting or tuning either the satellite digital broadcast signal or the cable broadcast signal (\\xb6\\xb6 [0055]-[0056]; Ans. 15).  Further, Ju (\\xb6 [0056]; Ans. 15) discloses that the broadcast/receiving module 210 also contains a signal processing unit 210 with channel decoder 215 for decoding and demultiplexing the received signals (i.e. demodulating and decoding) (Ans. 15).  Accordingly, Ju teaches all of the elements of the disputed limitation.  Thus, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejections of claim 1 and for the same reasons the rejections of claims 2, 7, 9, and 12-14, which were not separately argued.    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004784 Application 11/505,190   5Claims 3 and 22  Appellants argue with respect to claim 3 that Ju\\u2019s Figure 5B shows that the point of deployment (POD) is on the same circuit board as the tuner, and not separated from the tuner as required by the claim (App. Br. 10).  We are persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 argument.  The Examiner relies on a well-known rationale for the teaching that the PCB board layout may be varied (Ans. 16).  We are constrained by the record before us to reverse the Examiner\\u2019s rejection because the Examiner rejected this claim under anticipatory grounds rather than obviousness grounds.    Accordingly, we reverse the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 3 and for the same reason the rejection of claim 22.  Claims 4 and 5  Appellants argue that claims 4 and 5 are not taught by Ju (App. Br. 10-11).  We do not agree.  We adopt the Examiner\\u2019s findings and conclusion as stated in the Answer without having to repeat them herein (Ans. 17-18). Claim 6  Appellants rely on the same argument set forth with respect to claim 5.  Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 6.    Claims 8 and 25  Appellants argue that Ju does not teach a remote control board coupled to the integrated bus as recited in claim 8.   We do not agree.  We agree with the Examiner that Figure 4A shows a remote controller that sends a remote signal to the user input unit 106 and control unit 108 (i.e., remote control board). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004784 Application 11/505,190   6 Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 8 and for the same reasons the rejection of claim 25.  Claims 15, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26-29, and 31  We affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 15 because we agree with the Examiner that Ju teaches connecting the base module 100 to the function extended modules 210 using a bus, and thus, necessarily having the display 18 and speaker 12 receiving output from the base module 100 being \\u201cin communication\\u201d with the bus indirectly (see Figure 4A).  The claim does not require a direct connection.  Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 15.  For the same reasons we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26-29, and 31.     Claims 10, 11, and 16-18  With respect to claim 10, we adopt the Examiner\\u2019s findings and conclusions as stated in the Answer (Ans. 24).  Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 10 and for the same reasons the rejections of claims 11 and 16-18, which were not separately argued.  Claims 32 and 33 Appellants raise similar arguments to those raised with respect to claim 3 above (App. Br. 16-17).  However, this is an obviousness rejection and as such the Examiner\\u2019s rationale of reliance on a well-known rationale for the teaching that the PCB board layout may be varied (see Ans. 16), is persuasive.   Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 32 and for the same reasons the rejection of claim 33, which was not separately argued.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004784 Application 11/505,190   7CONCLUSIONS  The Examiner did not err in finding that Ju teaches \\u201ca tuner board receiving a satellite signal, said tuner board tuning, demodulating and decoding the satellite signal to form a second signal\\u201d as recited in claim 1. The Examiner erred in finding that Ju anticipates the limitation of \\u201cconditional access circuit is disposed on a conditional access board separated from the tuner board and the processor board\\u201d as recited in claim 3.    DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting claims 1, 2, 4-21, 23-29, and 31-33 is affirmed.  The Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting claims 3 and 22 is reversed. No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iv).   AFFIRMED-IN-PART   rwk \\x0c'},\n",

Ezhicon, Inc. v.\\nQuigg, 849 F.2d 1422, 1427 (Fed. Cir. 1988\\u2018) (explaining the general\\nevidentiary standard for proceedings before the Office). Additional facts\\nmay appear in the Analysis section.\\n1. Sichelman states at page 2:\\n\\nEach state approaches the problem differently, but most have\\nlaws on the books to deal with unresponsive lenders. In Florida,\\nfor example, lenders have 60 days to send the necessary\\ndocumentation to local authorities or 30 days if the borrower\\nputs his request in writing. If they fail to meet the deadline,\\nthey can be sued and held liable for eVeryone\\u2019s legal fees.\\n\\nIn California, lenders must have the reconveyance notice on the\\nrecorder\\u2019s desk within 30 days. How will you know when it\\u2019s\\ntime to worry? If your original mortgage (or deed of trust in\\nsome states) and note marked \\u201cCanceled, Paid in Full\\u201d are not\\nreturned to you by the lender within, say, 90 days, your antenna\\nshould wiggle. After three months, it\\u2019s time to get on the 110m\\nand find out what\\'s happening. And if you can\\u2019t get an\\nacceptable answer, you can \\ufb01le a formal complaint with DRE.\\n\\nANALYSIS\\n1l7d\\u20acp8l7d8I7f claim I and dependem claims 2-10\\nAppellant argues that the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 1 under\\n\\n35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a) because Sichehnan, on wl1icl1 the Examiner relies, does\\nnot disclose or suggest \\u201ca tracking program . . . that . . . determines whether\\nthe obligation underlying the lien for the transaction record has been\\n\\nsatis\\ufb01ed and the lien not released within a specified time period after theAppeal 2011-012436\\nApplication 10/308,268\\n\\nobligation has been satis\\ufb01ed, and in such instance sends out one or 111ore\\nnotifications,\\u201d as recited in claim 1 (App. Br. l8-l 9; see also Reply Br. 5-6).\\n\\nThe Examiner maintains that the rejection is proper and cites\\nSichelman at page 2. paragraphs 10-13 as disclosing the argued feature\\n(Ans. 6 and 23,). We agree witl1 Appellant.\\n\\nSichelman discloses that most states have \\u201claws on the books to deal\\nwith unresponsive lenders\\u201d and recommends \\ufb01ling a complaint if a\\nborrower\\u2019s original mortgage or deed of trust is not returned within a certain\\nnumber of days after satisfaction (FF 1\\u2018). However, we \\ufb01nd nothing in the\\ncited portion of Sichelman that discloses or suggests a \\u201ca tracking program\\n. . . that . . . determines whether the obligation underlying the lien for the\\ntransaction record has been satis\\ufb01ed and the lien not released within a\\nspeci\\ufb01ed time period . . . and . . . sends out . . . noti\\ufb01cations,\" as recited in\\nclaim 1. The best that the cited portion of Sichelman discloses is that a\\nborrower should consider getting on the \\u201chorn\\u201d to \\ufb01nd out what\\u2019s happening\\nif the satis\\ufb01ed deed of trust is not timely received. However, the lien may\\nwell have been released even if the lender has failed to return a satis\\ufb01ed\\ndeed of trust to the borrower.\\n\\nSichelman does not disclose or suggest a tracking program for\\ndetermining whether the lien l1as been released within a speci\\ufb01ed time\\nperiod. as required by claim 1. The Examiner also has not established on\\nthis record that Cohen or Raveis cures the de\\ufb01ciency of Sichel111an.\\n\\nTherefore, we will not sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1\\nunder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a). For the same reasons, we also will not sustain the\\n\\nrejection of clai111s 2-10, which depend on claim 1.Appeal 2011-012436\\nApplication 10/308,268\\nIndependent claim I I and dependent claims I 2-20\\n\\nIndependent claim 1 1 includes language substantially similar to the\\nlanguage ofclai111 1.

Oct. 13, 2005).Appeal 2011-004815\\nApplication 11/ 604,797\\nISSUES\\nThe issues are whether the Examiner erred in \\ufb01nding that:\\n1. The terms of \\u201cangular regions\\u201d of \\u201cone or more viewers\" as recited in\\nclaim 1 render the claim indefinite;\\n2. Perlin teaches the limitation of \\u201csegmenting a Viewing environment of\\nan image display panel into angular regions according to a current\\npositioning of one or more viewers of the image display panel\" as\\n\\nrecited in claims 1 and 13.\\n\\nANALYSIS\\n\\nInde\\ufb01netenexs\\n\\nThe Examiner \\ufb01nds that the limitation of \\u201csegmenting a viewing\\nenvironment of an image display panel into angular regions according to a\\ncurrent positioning of one or more Viewers of the image display panel, by a\\ncontrol unit\\u201d renders the claim inde\\ufb01nite because there is no more than one\\nangular region when there is one viewer in the environment (Ans. 3-4).\\n\\nAppellant argues that there are multiple angular regions even if there\\nis a single viewer directing our attention to Figures 2 and 5-6 (App. Br. 8).\\n\\nWe agree with Appellant that Figures 2 and 5-6 show different\\nangular regions, one for each of the viewer\\u2019s eyes. such as angular regions\\nR1, Ll for viewerPl (Fig. 2).\\n\\nAccordingly. we reverse the Examiner\\u2019s rejections of claims 1-21 as\\ninde\\ufb01nite.\\n\\nAnticipation\\nAppellant argues that paragraphs [0001], [0030], and [0033] of Perlin\\n\\nspeci\\ufb01cally fail to describe \\u201csegmenting a viewing environment of an image\\n\\nU)Appeal 2011-004815\\n\\nApplication 11/ 604,797\\n\\ndisplay panel into angular regions according to a current positioning of one\\nor more viewers of the image display panel\\u201d as recited in claim 1 (App. Br.\\n11:). Appellant asserts that Perlin merely locates a pair of eyeballs belonging\\nto a single viewer and transmits an image to that point. Locating and\\nprojecting images into a pair of eyeballs is not describing segmenting a\\nviewing environment as more fully disclosed in the Appellant\\u2019s\\nSpeci\\ufb01cation (Figs. 2 & 5, 11 [0030]; App. Br. 1 1). According to Appellant,\\nAppellant\\u2019s Speci\\ufb01cation speci\\ufb01cally distinguishes segmenting the viewing\\nenvironment into angular regions for a variety of data management purposes\\n(11 [0O30]) and as a frame of reference, as opposed to identifying and\\ntracking red eye regions (i.e., eyeballs\") which may be moving in an angular\\nregion (1111 [0009]\\u2014[O0l0]; App. Br. 11).\\n\\nWe do not agree. We agree with the Examiner\\'s findings that Perlin\\nteaches a unit which 11as a function to identify each of the positions where\\nthe viewer/observer stands, generates an angular space for each of the\\npositions and displays a particular true view of the objects based on each of\\nthe positions (Figs. 3a\\u20143b, 1111 [OOOI], [0030], and [0033], Ans. 10-11). ln\\nother words, Perlin\\u2019s apparatus teaches segmenting a viewing environment\\nof an image display panel into angular regions according to a current\\npositioning of viewers of tlie image display panel as recited in claims 1 and\\n13. We note that although claims are interpreted in light of the\\nSpeci\\ufb01cation, limitations from the Speci\\ufb01cation as argued by Appellant,\\nsuch as the reasoning for segmenting the viewing environment, are not read\\n\\ninto the claims. See In re Van Germs, 988 F.2d 1181, 1184 (Fed. Cir. 1993).Appeal 2011-004815\\nApplication 11/ 604,797\\n\\nAccordingly, we af\\ufb01rm tl1e Examiner\\u2019s rejections of claims 1 and 13\\nand for the same reasons the rejections ofclaims 2-4, 6, and 14-16 which\\nwere not separately argued.\\n\\nObviousness\\n\\nAppellant does not present additional arguments of patentability with\\nrespect to claims 5, 7-9, 17, and 18. Accordingly, we af\\ufb01rm the Examiner\\'s\\n\\nrejections of these claims for the same reasons as those articulated supra.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe Examiner erred in \\ufb01nding that:\\n1. The terms of \\u201cangular regions\\u201d of \\u201cone or more viewers\\u201d as recited in\\nclaim 1 render the claim inde\\ufb01nite.\\nThe Examiner did not err in \\ufb01nding that:\\n2.

FISCHETTI, MEREDITH C. PETRAVICK, and  PHILIP J. HOFFMANN, Administrative Patent Judges.  HOFFMANN, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL\\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012455 Application 11/512,827   2STATEMENT OF THE CASE Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from the rejection of claims 1-5 and 12-16.1  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b). We REVERSE. The rejected claims are directed to an agricultural irrigation assembly.  Claim 1, reproduced below and representative of the other claims on appeal, is the only independent claim. 1.  An agricultural irrigation assembly, comprising: an irrigation conduit; and at least one carrier substrate, each said carrier substrate being directly attached to said conduit along an entire length of said carrier substrate, each said carrier substrate carrying a plurality of seeds mounted to an exterior surface thereof for direct contact with soil which is exterior to said agricultural irrigation assembly. THE REJECTIONS The Examiner rejects the claims as follows: Claims 1-5 and 12-16 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Seith (US 3,848,359, iss. Nov. 19, 1974) in view of           JP 2007-222034 (pub. Sept. 6, 2007).                                            1 Our decision will refer to Appellants\\u2019 Specification (\\u201cSpec.,\\u201d filed August 30, 2006) and Appeal Brief (\\u201cBr.,\\u201d filed February 21, 2011), as well as the Examiner\\u2019s Answer (\\u201cAns.,\\u201d mailed May 9, 2011).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012455 Application 11/512,827   3ANALYSIS Independent claim 1 requires \\u201csaid carrier substrate [carrying a plurality of seeds] being directly attached to said [irrigation] conduit along an entire length of said carrier substrate.\\u201d  In the obviousness rejection, the Examiner states with respect to Seith that insert strip 12 (which may carry seeds) teaches the claimed carrier substrate, while irrigation tube 16 teaches the claimed irrigation conduit (Ans. 3-4).  The Examiner further states that Seith\\u2019s knitted-fabric cross links 14, which connect insert strip 12 and irrigation tube 16, teach the claimed direct attachment along an entire length of the carrier substrate (Ans. 4, 6).  In contrast, Appellants argue that because Seith uses cross links 14 to attach irrigation tube 16 with insert strip 12, which results in empty spaces between strip 12 and tube 16, strip 12 is not \\u201cdirectly attached\\u201d to tube 16, consistent with the limitations of claim 1 (Br. 10).  Appellants further argue that the intermittent placement of cross links 14 to attach tube 16 with strip 12 does not provide attachment \\u201calong an entire length\\u201d of strip 12, consistent with the limitations of claim 1 (Br. 10-11).  We agree with Appellants that the Examiner has not established that Seith teaches insert strip 12 is directly attached to irrigation tube 16 along an entire length of strip 12, and thus we find the Examiner has not established that Seith teaches the above-discussed limitations of claim 1, or provided a reason why this claim feature would be obvious over art showing an interrupted connection.  For these reasons, we are constrained to reverse the rejection of independent claim 1. Inasmuch as the remaining claims depend from claim 1, we also do not sustain the rejection of claims 2-5 and 12-16. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012455 Application 11/512,827   4DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 1-5 and 12-16 is REVERSED.

Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of\\nclaim 12 for the reasons set forth in the Answer, which we incorporate\\nherein by reference. (Ans. 5-6, 14-16.) Our additional analysis will be\\nlimited to the following points of emphasis.\\n\\nWe initially note that the argued limitations fail to structurally\\ndistinguish the claimed invention from the prior art.

Specifically,\\nthe Examiner provides a detailed explanation with respect to Neumann\\u2019s\\ndisclosure of a processing circuit maintaining image data (the position of\\nimage data in a display) while a use changes the orientation of a camera until\\nreceiving an aligmnent input. (Ans. 6-7. 16-17 (citing Neumann. 111] [0045]-\\n[0049], [O08l]\\u201c).\\u201c) From these findings, the Examiner concludes that Jung\\nand Neumann render Appellants\\u2019 claim 1 obvious. (Ans. 6-7, 16-17.) We\\nadopt these \\ufb01ndings and this reasoning as our own.\\n\\nUpon consideration of the evidence on this record and each of\\nAppellants\\u2019 contentions, we find that the preponderance of evidence on this\\nrecord supports the Examiner\\u2019s \\ufb01ndings that Jung and Neumann teach or\\nwould have at least suggested the disputed features of claim 1. Accordingly,\\nwe sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1 for the reasons set forth in the\\nAnswer, which we incorporate herein by reference. (Ans. 6-7, 16-17.) Our\\n\\nadditional analysis will be limited to the following points of emphasis.Appeal 2012-009613\\nApplication 12/535,841\\n\\nAs witl1 clai111 12 (supra), the limitations argued with respect to claim\\n1 fail to structurally distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art in\\nthat the disputed li111itations essentially consist of statements of intended use\\nor purpose of the processing circuit, which in this instance do not further\\nlimit the scope of the clai111. See Boehringer Ingelheim Vezmedica, Inc., 320\\nF.3d 1339 at 1345. Even if we arguendo ascribe some patentable weight to\\nthe statements of intended use, as explained by the Examiner (Ans. 5-6, 14-\\n16), Jung describes selectively displaying (see claim 12, supra). Further,\\nNeumann describes maintaining image data (the position of image data) in a\\ndisplay until a user matches the image data to new camera images (when a\\ncamera orientation is changed). (See Neumann, 1111 [0045]-[0049], [0081];\\nFig. 6.) Additionally, we note that Appellants failed to \\ufb01le a Reply Brief\\nrebutting the \\ufb01ndings and responsive arguments made by the Examiner in\\nthe Answer.\\n\\nThus, Appellants do not persuade us of error in the Examiner\\u2019s\\nobviousness rejection of representative independent claim 1, independent\\nclaim 14, and dependent claims 2-1 1 (dependent on claim 1), l3 (dependent\\non claim 12), and 16-20 (dependent on claim 14), not separately argued with\\nparticularity.

A turbine rotor for a gas turbine engine comprising:   a rotor disk having a central web which has an outer face spaced further downstream of a central axis than an outer face of a radially inner portion of the rotor disk;  a cover plate secured to the rotor disk, said cover plate having an enclosed chamber for moving air from a radially inner portion towards a radially outer portion and into cooling air passages to be associated with a turbine blade, said enclosed chamber being at least partially aligned with the central web, and said radially inner portion of said cover plate having ribs extending toward the radially inner portion of said rotor disk; and  said enclosed chamber defined by an upstream wall facing away from said rotor disk, and a downstream wall facing a surface of said rotor disk, said downstream wall ending radially outwardly of said radially inner portion of said cover plate.   REFERENCES Corsmeier Barbot US 5,018,943 US 5,700,130   May 28, 1991 Dec. 23, 1997 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012847 Application 11/768,996  3 REJECTIONS Claims 1-4, 6-9, 11, and 13-18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by Corsmeier.  Claims 1-3, 5-8, 10-12, and 13-18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by Barbot.  Claims 4 and 9 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Barbot and Corsmeier.    ANALYSIS Anticipation by Corsmeier The Examiner finds that Corsmeier discloses  a cover plate 68 secured to the rotor disk, the cover plate having an enclosed chamber near 76 for moving air from a radially inner portion A towards a radially outer portion B and into cooling air passages 24 to be associated with a turbine blade 20, the enclosed chamber being at least partially aligned with the central web, the radially inner portion of the cover plate having ribs 76 extending toward the radially inner portion of the rotor disk; and the enclosed chamber defined by an upstream wall C facing away from the rotor disk, and a downstream wall D facing a surface of the rotor disk, the downstream wall ending radially outwardly of the radially inner portion of the cover plate. Ans. 4-5 (citing the Examiner\\u2019s Annotated version of Corsmeier\\u2019 s Figure 2 at Ans. 6). Addressing claims 1 and 6, Appellants argue that the claims require \\u201c\\u2018ribs extending toward the radially inner portion of the rotor disk.\\u2019\\u201d  App. Br. 4.  Appellants further argue that \\u201c[t]he Corsmeier reference discloses ribs which are positioned within the enclosed chamber, but not ribs which extend toward the rotor disk.\\u201d  Id.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012847 Application 11/768,996  4 The Examiner responds \\u201cCorsmeier discloses ribs 76 positioned within the enclosed chamber near 76, which ribs clearly extend toward the rotor disk 10 . . . in a direction perpendicular to axis 14.\\u201d  Ans. 11.  As the ribs 76 extend vertically within the enclosed chamber, they extend toward the hub 12 of rotor disk 10.  A portion of the hub 12 is positioned vertically directly below the enclosed chamber.  See Corsmeier fig. 2.  As such, Corsmeier discloses \\u201cribs extending toward the radially inner portion of said rotor disk\\u201d as recited in claims 1 and 6.  Thus, we are not persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 arguments.  Accordingly, we sustain the rejection of independent claims 1 and 6 and dependent claims 2-4 and 7-9, which are not separately argued, as anticipated by Corsmeier. Addressing claim 11, Appellants argue \\u201c[c]laim 11 requires that a radially inner portion of the cover plate having ribs extending from an extension of the axially upstream wall.\\u201d  App. Br. 4.  In response, the Examiner finds \\u201cthe radially inner portion A has ribs extending from an extension of the axially upstream wall C.\\u201d  Ans. 11 (citing Corsmeier fig. 2 and Examiner\\u2019s annotated figure at Ans. 6). Appellants do not challenge the Examiner\\u2019s finding that radially inner portion A is an extension of the upstream wall C.  However, Appellants argue that \\u201cthe \\u2018radially inner portion of the rotor disk\\u2019 is directly to the right of the part and identified by the letter A.  The rib 76 is not extending in any fashion toward that structure, and thus Corsmeier does not meet the claims.\\u201d  Reply Br. 1.  This argument is not commensurate with the scope of the claims.  Claim 11 does not require the rib 76 to extend toward the inner portion of the rotor disk, but merely requires \\u201cribs extending from an extension of said axially upstream wall.\\u201d  App. Br. Clms. App\\u2019x.  As \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012847 Application 11/768,996  5 discussed above, the ribs 76 extend vertically within the enclosed chamber directly toward the hub 12 of the rotor disk 10.  Accordingly, we sustain the rejection of claim 11 and claims 13-18, which are not separately argued, as anticipated by Corsmeier.  Anticipation by Barbot Claims 1-3, 6-8, 10, 11, and 13-18 Appellants argue claims 1-3, 6-8, 10, 11, and 13-18 as a group and we select independent claim 1 as the representative claim.  See App. Br. 5; see also 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii) (2011).  Claims 2, 3, 6-8, 10, 11, and 13-18 stand or fall with claim 1.   The Examiner finds that Barbot discloses a  cover plate 5 secured to the rotor disk, the cover plate having an enclosed chamber near 9A1, 9B1 for moving air from a radially inner portion A or F towards a radially outer portion B and into cooling air passages to be associated with a turbine blade 2, the enclosed chamber being at least partially aligned with the central web, the radially inner portion of the cover plate having ribs 9A1 or 9B1 extending toward the radially inner portion of the rotor disk.   Ans. 6-7 (citing Examiner\\u2019s annotated version of Barbot\\u2019s Figure 2 at Ans. 9). Appellants argue that \\u201c[t]he Examiner appears to point to ribs on a completely separate part as shown in Figure 2.  The ribs 9A1 are formed on a part 9A, and not on the cover plate.  As such, they are not even part of the cover plate [5].\\u201d  App. Br. 5.  In response, the Examiner determines \\u201cBarbot discloses ribs 9A1, 9B1, which are located on the global cover plate 5.  The cover plate of Barbot is formed of several pieces (resulting in an integral cover plate), and there is no exclusionary proviso in the Appellant's claims \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012847 Application 11/768,996  6 to preclude the cover plate being formed of several pieces.\\u201d  Ans. 11.  We understand the global cover plate 5 to include the carrier disk 5, including elements 5a-5g, along with the attached sectors 9A and 9B which form a single integral cover plate when assembled.  Appellants further argue that \\u201c[t]he claims require \\u2018a cover plate\\u2019 which includes the structure.  The several assembled parts cannot meet the limitation of \\u2018a cover plate.\\u2019\\u201d  Reply Br. 2.  The Specification teaches \\u201c[t]he cover plate can be formed by machining operations in an integral component to create the chamber 68.  Spec. p.4, [para. 0020].  This disclosure suggests that forming the cover plate out of a single integral component is optional, thus indicating that it is possible to form the cover plate from several parts.  Thus, we are not persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 argument that the cover plate cannot be several pieces. Next, Appellants argue that \\u201ceven if this separate part could be considered part of the cover plate, it defines part of the enclosed chamber, and not the separate ribs.\\u201d  App. Br. 5.  As discussed above, the Examiner finds that the global cover plate 5 includes the ribs 9A1 and 9B1.  Thus, we are not persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 argument that the ribs 9A1 and 9B1 are not part of the cover plate 5.   Finally, Appellants argue Barbot\\u2019 s \\u201cribs extend away from the rotor disk, and not towards the disk as required.\\u201d  App. Br. 5.  In response, the Examiner determines  because ribs 9A1, 9B1 clearly extend toward the rotor disk 1, both in a direction perpendicular to element 1a (considered as extending toward the radially inner portion of the disk), as well as in a direction parallel to element 1a from the left hand side C of the cover plate 5 to the right hand side D of the cover plate 5 (also considered as extending toward the radially inner portion \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012847 Application 11/768,996  7 of the disk). Thus, the ribs meet the limitation of extending toward the radially inner portion of the rotor disk. Ans. 11-12 (citing Barbot fig. 2 and the Examiner\\u2019s annotated version of Barbot\\u2019s Figure 2 at Ans. 9).   As the ribs 9A1 extend radially inwardly and axially downstream within the enclosed chamber, they extend toward the innermost portion of the rotor disk 1, the bore 1a.  See Barbot Fig. 2.  As such, Barbot discloses a cover plate with \\u201cribs extending toward the radially inner portion of said rotor disk\\u201d as recited in claim 1.  Therefore, Appellants argument is not persuasive. For the forgoing reasons, we sustain the rejection of claim 1, and claims 2, 3, 6-8, 10, 11, and 13-18 which stand or fall therewith, as anticipated by Barbot.  Claim 5 Claim 5 recites the claim limitation of \\u201cwherein an abutment on said rotor disk serves to direct air into said enclosed chamber, and further provides a positioning stop for said cover plate.\\u201d  App. Br. 7, Clms. App\\u2019x.  The Examiner finds that Barbot discloses \\u201c[a]n abutment 9A/12A on the rotor disk serves to direct air into the enclosed chamber, and further provides a positioning stop for the cover plate.  Ans. 7.   Appellants argue, \\u201cif the ribs 9A1 are part of the cover plate, then surely the structure 9A/12A, which is associated with the rib 9A1 must also be cover plate, and is not the disk.\\u201d  App. Br. 5.  As discussed above, the Examiner finds that the fins 9A1, which are part of the sectors 9A, are part of the global cover plate 5.  See Ans. 7.  Barbot discloses that the teeth 12A are presented on the face of annular sectors 9A.  These teeth 12A mesh with \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012847 Application 11/768,996  8 the spaces between the tenons 13A integrally formed on the rotor disk.  See Barbot, col. 5, l. 64 to col. 6, l. 3.  Thus, the teeth 12A are on the sector 9A, not on the rotor disk 10.  Neither the sector 9A nor the teeth 12A are on the rotor disk as found by the Examiner.  Therefore, we are persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 argument that the Examiner\\u2019s findings are in error.  Accordingly, we do not sustain the rejection of Claim 5 as anticipated by Barbot.  Claim 12 Claim 12 recites the claim limitation of \\u201cfins being positioned radially inward of said enclosed chamber.\\u201d  App. Br. 9, Clms. App\\u2019x.  The Examiner finds \\u201cthe cover plate has fins 9A1 for moving air into the enclosed chamber, with the fins being positioned radially inward of the enclosed chamber.\\u201d  Ans. 7-8.  Appellants argue Barbot does not disclose \\u201cthe fins positioned radially inwardly of the enclosed chamber.\\u201d  App. Br. 5.  We agree with Appellants.  Barbot discloses fins 9A1 positioned within the enclosed chamber, but has no disclosure to support the Examiner\\u2019s finding of fins positioned radially inward of the enclosed chamber.  See Barbot fig. 2.   As such, we do not sustain the rejection of claim 12 as anticipated by Barbot.    Obviousness over Barbot and Corsmeier The Examiner finds that Barbot discloses substantially all of the elements of claims 4 and 9, but \\u201cdoes not disclose that the cover plate extends radially outwardly to be beyond a radially innermost portion of disk slots and the turbine blades.\\u201d  Ans. 10.  The Examiner finds that Corsmeier \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012847 Application 11/768,996  9 teaches \\u201ca turbine rotor having a cover plate 68 that extends radially outwardly to be beyond a radially innermost portion of disk slots 30 to receive turbine blades 20, for the purpose of supporting and restraining the turbine blades via the cover[]plate.\\u201d  Id.  The Examiner then concludes It would have been obvious . . . to form the turbine rotor and a gas turbine engine of Barbot such that the cover plate extends radially outwardly to be beyond a radially innermost portion of disk slots and the turbine blades, as taught by Corsmeier, for the purpose of supporting and restraining the turbine blades via the coverplate. Id.  Appellants argue \\u201cthere is no reason to so modify Barbot . . . .  Barbot . . . discloses a detailed structure which would require complete re-engineering to incorporate this change.\\u201d  App. Br. 6.  In response, the Examiner determines \\u201c[m]erely lengthening the cover plate such that it extends radially outwardly to be beyond a radially innermost portion of disk slots and the turbine blades involves routine skill in the art and is taught by Corsmeier.\\u201d  Ans. 13.  In reply, Appellants assert that Barbot \\u201chas seal structure 6[a] in the location adjacent to the root of the blades.  It would destroy the function of providing sealing to \\u2018merely extend\\u2019 the cover plate into this area.\\u201d  Reply Br. 2.    First, we should note that Appellants fail to address the Examiner\\u2019s articulated reasoning to extend the cover plate \\u201cfor purpose of supporting and restraining the turbine blades via the cover[]plate.\\u201d  Ans. 10.  One of ordinary skill in the art would agree that the Examiner\\u2019s proposed modification is reasonable and satisfies the Examiner\\u2019s initial burden to set forth the basis for the rejection\\u2014the so-called \\u201cprima facie case.\\u201d  Thus, the Examiner has shifted the burden to Appellants.  See In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992).  Appellants present no arguments to counter the \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012847 Application 11/768,996  10 Examiner\\u2019s articulated reasoning to combine Barbot and Corsmeier.  Therefore, we are not apprised of any Examiner error in the Examiner\\u2019s articulated reasoning Next, we address whether the proposed modification would destroy the function of providing sealing with the sealing structure 6a when the cover plate is extended beyond the innermost portion of the disk slots.  Figure 2 of Barbot shows that there is a substantial gap between the disk and seal 6a which would allow the cover plate to be extended without interfering with the functionality of the sealing structure 6a.  Furthermore, as disclosed in the embodiment of Figure 1 of Barbot, it is known by one skilled in the art to modify the sealing structure 6a to provide additional space near the disk slots to accommodate a cooling path directly to the disk slots.  Thus, one skilled in the art would be able to modify Barbot, with the teachings of Corsmeier without destroying the functionality of the sealing structure 6a.  Accordingly, we are not persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 argument that extending the cover plate 68 would destroy the function of providing sealing with the sealing structure 6a. For the reasons above, we sustain the rejection of claims 4 and 9 as unpatentable over Barbot and Corsmeier.     \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012847 Application 11/768,996  11 DECISION For the above reasons, the Examiner\\u2019s decision to reject claims 1-4, 6-11, and 13-18 is affirmed, and the Examiner\\u2019s decision to reject claims 5 and 12 is reversed.  No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iv).  AFFIRMED-IN-PART                   rvb \\x0c\"},\n",

However, we fully concur with the Examiner\\'s reasoned\\nanalysis and application of the prior art, as well as the Examiner\\'s cogent and\\nthorough disposition of the arguments raised by Appellants. Accordingly,\\nwe will adopt the Examiner\\'s reasoning as our own in sustaining the\\nrejections of record, and we add the following for emphasis only.\\n\\nThere is no dispute that lnoue, like Appellants, discloses a\\npyroelectric device positioned within a housing comprising a substrate\\nwhich passes radiation of a speci\\ufb01ed wavelength band to a pyroelectric\\nelement for initiating an electric signal, and an interference \\ufb01lter associated\\nwitl1 the substrate for preventing the passage of radiation with other\\nwavelengths. While lnoue is silent with respect to the particulars of the\\n\\ninterference \\ufb01lter, we agree with the Examiner that Steinhage evidences theAppeal 2011-005521\\nApplication 1 l/778,742\\n\\nobviousness of using an interference \\ufb01lter that blocks radiation coming from\\nautomobile headlamps when the device is used as an intrusion detector.\\n\\nAlthough, as stressed by Appellants, Steinhage employs a coating\\nwl1icl1 absorbs oncoming beams, Hardee teaches that it was known in the art\\nto use interference \\ufb01lters comp\\ufb01sing a plurality of coating layers of\\nspeci\\ufb01ed thicknesses wl1ich do not absorb radiation, explaining that such\\nabsorption of radiation renders the device susceptible to temperature\\nincreases which can result in signi\\ufb01cant wavelength shifts or physical\\ndamage to the system. Accordingly, based on the collective teachings of the\\nprior art, we agree with the Examiner that it would have been obvious for\\none of ordinary skill in the art to employ an interference \\ufb01lter in the\\npyroelectric sensing device of lnhou which blocks the transmission of\\nradiation from automobile head lamps and comprises a plurality of coating\\nlayers of speci\\ufb01ed thicknesses which do not absorb radiation that generates\\nheat.\\n\\nAppellants emphasize that Hardee discloses that 111ost bandpass\\ninterference \\ufb01lters are constructed with absorptive auxiliary blocking\\ncomponents, and, therefore, \"it is only logical to assume that 111ost (if not all)\\nof the Hardee et al. \\ufb01lters would also use absorptive components [and] it is\\nalso only logical to conclude that Hardee et al. teaches away from\\ninterference \\ufb01lters without absorptive components\" (Prin. Br. 17, \\ufb01rst para.).\\nWe are not, however, persuaded by this argument. Manifestly, inasmuch as\\nHardee teaches that \"111ost\" \\ufb01lters have absorptive components, it logically\\nfollows that Hardee also teaches that some \\ufb01lters do not have absorptive\\n\\ncomponents. In addition, as pointed out by the Examiner, Hardee explicitlyAppeal 2011-005521\\nApplication 1 l/778,742\\n\\nteaches that, for some applications, \\ufb01lters comprising absorptive\\ncomponents are not desirable due to temperature increases, and the reference\\nexpressly discloses interference \\ufb01lters comprising a plurality of coating\\nlayers witl1 speci\\ufb01ed thicknesses. ln our view, one of ordinary skill in the\\nart. observing that an absorptive \\ufb01lter for automobile head lamps generates\\nheat that causes false alarms, would have found the solution to the problem\\nas the obvious use of an interference \\ufb01lter that does not absorb radiation and\\ngenerate heat. We are convinced that the discovery of the problem of using\\nan absorptive \\ufb01lter, as well as its solution, would have been obvious to one\\nof ordinary skill in the art.

DECISION ON APPEAL\\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  2   This proceeding arose from a third party request on behalf of CME Group, Inc., New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., and Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. for an inter partes reexamination of U. S. Patent 7,417,568 B2 (the \\u2019568 patent), entitled \\u201cSystem and Method for Data Feed Acceleration and Encryption,\\u201d assigned to Realtime Data LLC and issued to James J. Fallon, Paul F. Pickel, Stephen J. McErlain, and Carlton W. Melone (August 26, 2008).  The Examiner refuses to adopt the proposed rejections of claims 3, 6-8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20-27, 29-37, 40, 41, 45-51, 53-62, 67, 69, and 70.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7\\xa7 134(b) and 306.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE The \\u2019568 patent describes transmission of broadcast data over a communication channel using data compression and decompression (col. 6, ll. 4-7). Claim 20 on appeal reads as follows: 20.  A method for creating a data feed dependent data compression routine, the method comprising: creating a description file that describes one or more data fields and one or more encoders associated with each data field; processing the description file with a data compression compiler; and outputting an executable file that is used to process a stream of data by recognizing data field types in the data stream and applying encoders associated with the recognized data field types to encode the data stream.

The Requester appeals the Examiner\\u2019s decision not to adopt the following proposed rejections: Claims 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20-26, 29-32, 40, and 46-48 under  35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by XMill; Claims 3, 6-8, 33-37, 51, 53-56, and 60-62 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XMill, Danskin-1, and Birdwell; Claims 26, 27, and 49 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XMill and Willis; Claims 6-8, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20-26, 29-32, 34-37, 40, and 46-48 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by Danskin-1; Claim 50 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Danskin-1, alone or in combination with Danskin-2; Claims 3, 33, 37, 53-62, 69, and 70 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Danskin-1 and Birdwell; \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  4  Claims 26, 27, and 49 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Danskin-1 and Willis; Claims 6, 10, 12, 15, 20-25, 29-33, and 40 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102 as being anticipated by Sebastian; Claims 14, 26, 27, 37, and 49 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Sebastian and Willis; Claims 30, 32, 33, 47, and 48 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Sebastian and Osler; Claim 46 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Sebastian, Willis, and Osler; Claims 14 and 15 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Sebastian and Danskin-1; Claim 3 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Sebastian and Birdwell; Claims 3, 6, 8, 14, 15, 31, 32, 40, and 47 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Carr and Franaszek; Claims 15, 26, 27, and 49 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Carr, Franaszek, and Fascenda; Claims 25, 27, 29, 30, 33, 37, 47 and 48 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Carr, Franaszek, and Birdwell; Claims 6, 8, 12, 31, 32, 34, 40, 41, and 45 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102 as being anticipated by Hauck; Claims 3, 27, 29, 30, 33, 37, and 67 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Hauck and Birdwell; Claims 6, 14, 20, 22, 24, 25, 31, 32, 40, 47, and 48 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102 as being anticipated by XML; \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  5  Claims 3, 15, and 23 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XML and Carr; Claims 25, 27, 29, 30, 33, and 37 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XML and Birdwell; Claims 14, 26, 27, 37, and 46 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XML and Willis; Claims 15, 26, 27, 46, and 49 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XML and Fascenda; Claims 6, 29, 30, 47, and 48 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XML and Sebastian; Claim 14 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Carr and Franaszek. The Requester also argues that claims 1-41, 45-62, 67, 69, and 70 are not entitled to the priority date of U.S. Patent Application No. 09/969,987, filed October 3, 2001.   DISCUSSION XMill Reference The Examiner finds that XMill fails to disclose a data packet because, according to the Examiner, a \\u201cpacket\\u201d as recited in claim 3, for example, \\u201cinclude[s] more than a mere segregation of data\\u201d (ACP 21).  In support of this finding, the Examiner states that Birdwell discloses \\u201c\\u2018packets\\u2019 with uncompressed/compressed headers,\\u201d Carr discloses \\u201cdata \\u2018packets\\u2019 which include at least static and dynamic fields,\\u201d and XML discloses \\u201ccompression at a \\u2018file\\u2019 level [that is distinguished] from compression at the \\u2018packet\\u2019 level\\u201d (ACP 21).  Hence, the Examiner defines a data packet, as recited in \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  6  claim 3, for example, as a \\u201csegregation of data\\u201d that also must include \\u201cuncompressed/compressed headers\\u201d (according to Birdwell), \\u201cstatic and dynamic fields\\u201d (according to Carr), and a method of compression that is \\u201cdistinguished from\\u201d compression of a \\u201cfile\\u201d (according to XML). The Examiner relies on the Birdwell reference to support the position that a data packet must contain \\u201cuncompressed/compressed headers.\\u201d  As the Examiner points out, Birdwell discloses \\u201cfull-length data packets, which have uncompressed headers, and reduced-length data packets, which have compressed headers\\u201d (col. 2, ll. 15-17).  However, at best, Birdwell discloses the use of full-length data packets, which have compressed headers and reduced-length data packets, which have compressed headers.  The Examiner does not persuasively demonstrate that Birdwell also discloses that all data packets must include compressed or uncompressed headers and that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that any segregation of data lacking an uncompressed or compressed header is not a data packet.  Similarly, the Examiner relies on the Carr reference to support the position that a data packet must contain \\u201cstatic and dynamic fields.\\u201d  As the Examiner points out, Carr discloses a system \\u201cthat employs data packets which include at least static and dynamic fields\\u201d (col. 3, ll. 31-33).  At best, Carr discloses a system that utilizes data packets with static or dynamic fields.  The Examiner does not persuasively demonstrate that Carr also discloses that all data packets must include static and/or dynamic fields and that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that any segregation of data lacking a static or dynamic field is not a data packet.  The Examiner relies on the XML reference to support the position that a data packet must be compressed in a manner that is \\u201cdistinguished from\\u201d \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  7  compression of a \\u201cfile.\\u201d  As the Examiner points out, XML discloses a \\u201cdemo\\u201d that \\u201ccompresses at the file level\\u201d and a system in which \\u201ceach input packet is encoded as [quickly] as it is received\\u201d (p. 4).  At best, XML discloses a system that encodes packets as quickly as they are received.  The Examiner does not persuasively demonstrate that XML discloses that all data packets must include any specific feature.  While XML discloses, a system that encodes packets as quickly as the packets are received, we disagree with the Examiner that the system quickly encoding packets constitutes a definition of a data packet as would have been understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.   Given that none of Birdwell, Carr, or XML discloses a specific definition of a data packet and none of the references disclose any specifically required feature of a data packet as would have been understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, we cannot agree with Examiner\\u2019s position a data packet must \\u201cinclude . . . more than a mere segregation of data\\u201d (ACP 21). Patent Owner argues that a \\u201cdata packet\\u201d is a \\u201cunit of information transmitted from one device to another on a network\\u201d (PO Rebuttal Br. 6, citing Microsoft Computer Dictionary, 327 (4th ed. 1999)).  Even assuming Patent Owner\\u2019s contention to be correct, Patent Owner has not persuasively demonstrated that XMill fails to disclose a \\u201cunit of information transmitted from one device to another.\\u201d  For example, XMill discloses \\u201cdata exchange\\u201d (p. 1) and an \\u201cinformation source, a channel, and a destination\\u201d for data and \\u201cinformation can be sent by the source to the destination through the channel\\u201d (p. 8).  Hence, XMill discloses data that is transmitted (i.e., from a \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  8  source to a destination), which Patent Owner argues is the definition of the term \\u201cpacket.\\u201d  Also, as the Requester points out, the Specification discloses that \\u201c[i]f there is internal structure to packets, such as a header . . ., additional global states could be added\\u201d (col. 10, ll. 39-53; 3PR App. Br. 7; Declaration under 37 C.F.R. 1.132 of Paul C. Clark, dated August 17, 2011 (\\u201cClark Declaration\\u201d), \\xb6 47).  In other words, the Specification does not disclose that a data packet must contain an internal structure.  Indeed, the Specification explicitly discloses that a packet may have an internal structure (i.e., \\u201cif\\u201d there is an internal structure), such as a header, and therefore implies that an internal structure is an optional feature of a data packet.  The Examiner does not persuasively rebut the Requester\\u2019s argument.  Therefore, we agree with Requester that a broad but reasonable construction of the term \\u201cdata packet\\u201d includes a segregation of data that does not require a specific internal structure.      XMill discloses compression and decompression of XML data (p. 2, l. 1) that is \\u201csemistructured data\\u201d (p. 2, l. 4) that may be grouped into \\u201ccontainers\\u201d (p. 2. \\u2013 \\u201cgrouping data items in containers\\u201d).  The Examiner does not adequately point out any substantial differences between the \\u201csemistructured data\\u201d in containers (i.e., segregation of data) and the \\u201cdata packet\\u201d as claimed.  While Patent Owner argues that \\u201cthe container-specific encoders in XMill [do not] apply to, or operate on \\u2018data packets\\u2019\\u201d (PO Rebuttal Br. 10), Patent Owner does not persuasively demonstrate a difference between the \\u201ccontainer\\u201d of XMill and the claimed \\u201cpacket.\\u201d  Both the \\u201ccontainer\\u201d of XMill and the claimed \\u201cpacket\\u201d contain data and are transmitted from a source to a destination. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  9  The Examiner states that XMill fails to disclose recognizing a data field type of a data field included in a packet because, according to the Examiner, XMill fails to disclose a data packet (ACP 23, 25).  We disagree with the Examiner for previously stated reasons and for reasons set forth by the Requester (3PR App. Br. 6-8). The Examiner also states that while XMill discloses a compressor, the compressor of XMill is not the same as an \\u201cexecutable file\\u201d as claimed because the compressor of XMill, according to Requester, is the claimed \\u201cencoder\\u201d and \\u201ccannot read on both the distinctly claimed \\u2018executable file\\u2019 and \\u2018encoder\\u2019\\u201d (ACP 28).  Claims 20-23, for example, recite an executable file that is used to process a stream of data by recognizing data field types in the data stream and applying encoders associated with the recognized data field types.  We disagree with the Examiner for at least the reasons set forth by the Requester (3PR App. Br. 8-9). As the Requester points out, XMill discloses different compressors that are used to compress different types of data, including \\u201cspecialized compressors if [users] have complex, application specific data types\\u201d (p. 2).1  Hence, XMill discloses processing a stream of data and applying a corresponding encoder based on the types of data in the data stream.  The Examiner does not persuasively demonstrate a difference between applying encoders associated with recognized data types (e.g., applying a specialized                                            1 XMill also discloses, for example, \\u201c[c]omplex compressors . . . for a variety of specialized data types, e.g. images, sound, DNA sequences\\u201d (p. 8) and that \\u201cusers can write new . . . compressors and link them to XMill\\u201d which is \\u201cuseful when . . . data contains highly specialized types, like DNA sequences, for which special purpose compressors exists\\u201d (p. 9, 4th paragraph). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  10  compressor to compress data of a corresponding specific data type as disclosed by XMill) and the claim limitation of applying encoders associated with the recognized data field types. The Examiner states that the compressor of XMill \\u201ccannot read on both the distinctly claimed \\u2018executable file\\u2019 and \\u2018encoder\\u2019\\u201d (ACP 28).  However, as the Requester points out, XMill discloses, for example, a \\u201cpath processor that determines how to map data values to containers\\u201d (p. 9, 2nd paragraph) and associating \\u201csemantic compressors with containers\\u201d (p. 9, 4th paragraph), the data in the containers being compressed by the corresponding compressor (p. 9, 3rd paragraph \\u2013 \\u201call containers are . . . stored on disk, and the compression resumes . . . \\u201cinput file[s] . . . are compressed independently\\u201d).  In other words, XMill discloses an \\u201cexecutable file\\u201d (e.g., a path processor that determines how to map data values to containers \\u2013 p. 9, Fig. 4) the recognizes data types of the input data (and sorted into containers) and applies a corresponding encoder (data in containers are compressed by corresponding specialized encoders).  The Examiner does not persuasively demonstrate a difference between XMill and the disputed claim limitations. The Examiner states that XMill (and Danskin-1) fails to disclose a financial data feed (ACP 31, citing Clark Declaration, and Modestino Declaration).  Claims 53-62, for example, recite recognizing a data field type of a data field in a financial data feed.  We disagree with the Examiner for at least the reasons set forth by the Requester (3PR App. Br. 9-11). In addition, our reviewing court has held that nonfunctional descriptive material cannot lend patentability to an invention that otherwise would have been unpatentable over the prior art.  In re Ngai, 367 F.3d 1336, \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  11  1339 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Cf. In re Gulack, 703 F.2d 1381, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (when descriptive material is not functionally related to the substrate, the descriptive material will not distinguish the invention from the prior art in terms of patentability).  The Examiner need not give patentable weight to descriptive material absent a new and unobvious functional relationship between the descriptive material and the substrate.  See In re Lowry, 32 F.3d 1579, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1994). In the present case, claims 53-62 recite a data field in a financial data feed. In each of these claims, descriptive material is recited without a specific functional relationship to the \\u201csubstrate\\u201d.  For example, while claim 53 recites the data field is in a \\u201cfinancial data feed,\\u201d claim 53 does not recite a specific functional relationship between the type of data (i.e., \\u201cfinancial data feed\\u201d) and any of the steps of the method of recognizing a data field, selecting an encoder, compressing data, broadcasting the compressed data, or utilizing a descriptor.  Instead, each of the steps of the method of claim 53 would exhibit no functional difference if the type of data (i.e., \\u201cfinancial data feed\\u201d) were to include other types of data (e.g., non-financial data) since claim 53 does not require any specific function of the specific type of data.   Hence, we need not accord patentable weight to non-functional descriptive material (i.e., \\u201cfinancial data feed\\u201d).  As such, the Examiner has not demonstrated that XMill fails to disclose features recited in claims 53-62. The Examiner does not provide additional findings with respect to any of Danskin, Birdwell, or Willis in combination with XMill. Reversal of the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt the proposed rejections of claims 3, 6-7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20-27, 29-37, 40, 46-49, 51, 53-56, 60-\\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  12  62, 67, 69, and 70 over XMill, either alone or in combination with Danskin-1, Birdwell, and/or Willis renders it unnecessary to reach the propriety of the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt proposed rejections of those claims on a different basis.  Cf. In re Gleave, 560 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  As such, we need not reach the propriety of the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt the proposed rejections of those claims over Danskin-1, Danskin-2, Birdwell, Willis, Sebastian, Willis, Osler, Carr, Franaszek, Fascenda, Hauck, or XML. We also need not consider the Requester\\u2019s arguments pertaining to priority of the \\u2019568 patent.   Danskin-1 \\u2013 Claims 50 and 57-59 The Examiner also finds that Danskin-1 discloses a \\u201ctype of the message\\u201d but that the type of the message \\u201cdo[es] not relate to encoders\\u201d (ACP 24).  Hence, the Examiner finds that Danskin-1 fails to disclose, \\u201cproviding a descriptor with the encoded data which identifies the selected encoder.\\u201d  Claim 50, which depends from claim 1, recites providing a descriptor with the encoded data which identifies the selected encoder.  Claim 53 recites recognizing a data field type and selecting an encoder associated with the recognized data field type. Requester argues that Danskin discloses \\u201cmessage-type tags and opcodes . . . which identifies the selected encoder\\u201d (3PR App. Br. 13, citing Danskin 83, 91, 120).  We agree with Requester that Danskin discloses \\u201ctags\\u201d that describe a \\u201cmessage type\\u201d (p. 121) and \\u201copcodes\\u201d (p. 120; Fig. 16-28).  However, Requester does not sufficiently demonstrate that either the \\u201cmessage-type tags\\u201d or the \\u201copcodes\\u201d \\u201ccorrespond to the encoders for that message type\\u201d as Requester asserts.  Rather, it appears that the \\u201ctag\\u201d \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  13  (along with \\u201cOffset\\u201d) corresponds to a \\u201cPredictive Model\\u201d (p. 121; Fig. 16-28) that, in turn, \\u201cindicates which contexts were used to index models for prediction\\u201d (p. 121, ll. 1-2).  Thus, the \\u201ctag\\u201d of Danskin corresponds to a predictive model indicating a context to index models for prediction rather than an encoder used to compress data blocks as recited in claim 1.   Requester has also provided insufficient support for the contention that the \\u201copcodes\\u201d of Danskin indicate encoders used to compress data blocks.  Rather, the \\u201copcode\\u201d of Danskin appears to be a field in a request that corresponds to a \\u201cpredictive model\\u201d described by a \\u201ctag\\u201d and offset (Figs. 16-28).  Alternatively, one of ordinary skill in the art would have utilized a plain and customary meaning of the term \\u201copcode\\u201d to include an \\u201coperational code\\u201d that is used to specify an operation to be performed.  In either case, whether the \\u201copcode\\u201d of Danskin corresponds to a \\u201cpredictive model\\u201d or whether the \\u201copcode\\u201d of Danskin indicates an operation to be performed, Requester has not adequately demonstrated that the \\u201copcode\\u201d indicates an encoder used to compress data. Requester does not rely on Danskin-2 or Birdwell to make up for the deficits of Danskin-1. The Examiner did not err in not adopting the proposed rejection of claims 50 and 57-59 over Danskin-1 alone or in combination with Danskin-2 or Birdwell.  Hauck \\u2013 claims 41 and 45 As described above, the Examiner finds that Hauck fails to disclose a data \\u201cpacket\\u201d (ACP 23).  Claims 41 and 45, which depend from claim 1, recite a data packet.  We disagree with the Examiner for at least the reasons \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  14  set forth by the Requester (3PR App. Br. 23-24) and reasons previously described above.   For example, Hauck discloses \\u201ccompressing and/or decompressing data during transmission of data within a computer system\\u201d (col. 5, ll. 45-47).  The Examiner does not persuasively demonstrate a difference between computer data that is transmitted (i.e., transmission of data within a computer system) and a data packet (or a \\u201csegregation\\u201d of data \\u2013 see above). The Examiner erred in not adopting the proposed rejection of claims 41 and 45 over Hauck.  DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s decision not to reject claim 50 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Danskin-1, alone or in combination with Danskin-2, and claims 57-69 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Danskin-1 and Birdwell is affirmed. The Examiner\\u2019s decision not to reject claims 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20-26, 29-32, 40, and 46-48 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by XMill; claims 3, 6-8, 33-37, 51, 53-56, and 60-62 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XMill, Danskin-1, and Birdwell; claims 26, 27, and 49 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XMill and Willis; and  claims 41 and 45 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102 as being anticipated by Hauck is reversed.   Pursuant to 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.77(a), the above-noted reversal constitutes a new ground of rejection.  Section 41.77(b) provides that \\u201c[a] new ground of rejection . . . shall not be considered final for judicial review.\\u201d  That section also provides that Patent Owner, WITHIN ONE MONTH FROM \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007689 Reexamination Control 95/001,533 Patent 7,417,568 B2  15  THE DATE OF THE DECISION, must exercise one of the following two options with respect to the new grounds of rejection to avoid termination of the appeal proceeding as to the rejected claims: (1) Reopen prosecution. The owner may file a response requesting reopening of prosecution before the examiner.  Such a response must be either an amendment of the claims so rejected or new evidence relating to the claims so rejected, or both.           (2) Request rehearing.  The owner may request that the proceeding be reheard under \\xa7 41.79 by the Board upon the same record.  The request for rehearing must address any new ground of rejection and state with particularity the points believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked in entering the new ground of rejection and also state all other grounds upon which rehearing is sought.  In accordance with 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.79(a)(1), the \\u201c[p]arties to the appeal may file a request for rehearing of the decision within one month of the date of: . . . [t]he original decision of the Board under \\xa7 41.77(a).\\u201d  A request for rehearing must be in compliance with 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.79(b).

DECISION ON APPEAL  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011197 Application 10/993,518  2 STATEMENT OF CASE Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 from the rejection of claims 1, 10, 12, 13, 16-22, 29 and 32.  Claims 2-9 and 23-28 have been withdrawn from consideration.  Claims 11, 14, 15, 30, 31, 33 and 34 have been canceled.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b). We AFFIRM.  CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER The claims are directed to a multi-effect cooling system utilizing heat from an engine.  Claims 1, 17 and 22 are independent.  Claim 1 is reproduced below: 1.  A method of operating a multi-effect cooling system, including a primary desorber, a secondary desorber, a primary condenser, a secondary condenser, and a heat exchanger, said multi-effect cooling system utilizing heat generated from an engine having an exhaust system and cooling system, said primary condenser dissipating heat during operation thereof, the method comprising: heating the primary desorber using heat from the exhaust system; heating the secondary desorber using heat from the cooling system; collecting the heat dissipated by the primary condenser; transferring the collected heat from the primary condenser to the secondary desorber; transferring desorbed refrigerant from the secondary desorber to the secondary condenser; and   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011197 Application 10/993,518  3 dispersing heat generated from at least one of the secondary desorber and the secondary condenser through the heat exchanger, wherein the heat exchanger is configured to disperse the heat outside of the multi-effect cooling system.  PRIOR ART  Mori   US 4,439,999  Apr. 3, 1984  Sarkisian  US 4,542,628  Sep. 24, 1985  Rockenfeller US 5,335,515  Aug. 9, 1994  Bass   US 5,625,245  Apr. 29, 1997  Aikawa  US 6,807,820 B2  Oct. 26, 2004  GROUNDS OF REJECTION 1. Claims 1, 10 and 16 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Rockenfeller and Mori. 2. Claim 12 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Rockenfeller, Mori, and Sarkisian. 3. Claim 13, 17-22, and 29 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Rockenfeller, Mori, and Aikawa. 4. Claim 32 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Rockenfeller, Mori, Aikawa, and Bass.  OPINION Claims 1, 10 and 16  Appellants argue claims 1, 10 and 16 as a group.  See App. Br. 9-14.  We select independent claim 1 as the representative claim and claims 10 and 16 stand or fall with claim 1.  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii) (2011).  The Examiner finds that Rockenfeller discloses a triple effect cooling system and operating method including every limitation of independent \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011197 Application 10/993,518  4 claim 1 except that \\u201cRockenfeller fails to disclose that heat generated by an engine having an exhaust system and a cooling system is utilized.\\u201d  Ans. 5.  In particular, the Examiner determines that \\u201cthe heat exchanger is configured to disperse the heat outside of the multi-effect cooling system (via \\u2018squiggly\\u2019 arrow exiting the top of C1).\\u201d  Id.  The Examiner finds that Mori \\u201cteaches the well known concept of heating a primary desorber (first generator) with heat from an engine exhaust (3A) and heating a secondary desorber (second generator) with heat from an engine (12) cooling system (via cooling fluid in line 14 and 4A).\\u201d  Id.  Based on these findings, the Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious \\u201cto have modified the system of Rockenfeller to include the use of engine exhaust and cooling system heat as taught by Mori in order to provide an additional source of cooling to an engine powered system, thus increasing the cooling effectiveness of the engine powered cooling system.\\u201d  Ans. 5-6. Appellants argue that \\u201cthe Examiner's assertion that the \\u2018squiggly\\u2019 line exiting the top of the low temperature condenser C1 is an indication that heat is being dispersed outside of the Rockenfeller cooling system is not supported by the Rockenfeller disclosure.\\u201d  App. Br. 12; Reply Br. 6.  Appellants base their argument on the fact that Rockenfeller is silent as to the meaning of the \\u201csquiggly\\u201d line.  Appellants further suggest that the \\u201csquiggly\\u201d line could \\u201cjust as likely [indicate] that the heat being released from the low temperature condenser C1 is being used to heat . . .  the fluid being supplied from the evaporator (E) to the adsorber (A) or from the adsorber (A) to the primary desorber G3.\\u201d  App. Br. 12. Appellants\\u2019 argument is not persuasive.  In Rockenfeller\\u2019s figure 8 heat is passed between the various components via the fluid in absorption \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011197 Application 10/993,518  5 fluid loop 44 which is represented by solid arrows and by direct heat exchange which is represented by \\u201csquiggly\\u201d arrows.  See Rockenfeller, col. 5, ll. 35-37; col. 2, ll. 51-60.  The heat from Rockenfeller\\u2019s condenser C1 being used to heat the fluid supplied from the evaporator E to the adsorber A is represented by the solid arrow between C1 and E and the solid arrow between E and A.  Similarly, the heat from C1 being used to heat the fluid supplied from adsorber A to the primary desorber G3 is represented by the solid arrow between C1 and E, the solid arrow between E and A and the solid arrow passing through pump 45, three unlabeled heat exchangers and mechanical skimmer 40.  Whereas, direct heat exchange between condenser C3 and desorber G2 and between condenser C2 and desorber G1 is represented by \\u201csquiggly\\u201d arrows.  In other words, Rockenfeller uses solid arrows to indicate heat exchange via a fluid loop and \\u201csquiggly\\u201d arrows to indicate direct heat exchange with the arrow indicating the destination of the heat.  Thus, the Examiner\\u2019s determination that a \\u201csquiggly\\u201d arrow from a component, such as C1, that doesn\\u2019t connect to another component in the system indicates that \\u201cheat is being dispersed away from the system\\u201d is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  Ans. 14.   Appellants further argue \\u201cRockenfeller fails to disclose that heat generated in the secondary desorber (G2) or the secondary condenser C2 is dispersed outside of the triple effect absorption apparatus\\u201d because Rockenfeller discloses that the heat from the secondary desorber G2 and the secondary condenser C2 is supplied directly to the third desorber G1 to drive vapor generation in the third desorber G1.\\u201d  App. Br. 13; Reply Br. 7.    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011197 Application 10/993,518  6 In response to this argument, the Examiner correctly finds that: as shown in figure 8 of Rockenfeller, refrigerant flows from secondary desorber (generator) G2 to secondary condenser (condenser) C2 illustrating that heat is transferred from generator G2 to condenser C2.  Also, refrigerant from condenser G2 is sent to condenser Cl, and heat is dispersed from condenser Cl, thus illustrating that heat is transferred from condenser C2 to condenser C1. This shows that heat transferred from both generator G2 and condenser C2 is transferred to condenser Cl and then transferred out of the system. Ans. 14-15.  The fact that heat is also transferred from condenser C2 and generator G2 to generator G1 does not negate these findings.  Further, claim 1 does not preclude additional heat transfer or transfer between various components of the system prior to dispersion of the heat through the heat exchanger.1  Accordingly, Appellants\\u2019 argument is not persuasive.  For these reasons, we find no deficiencies in the Examiner\\u2019s findings with respect to Rockenfeller and we sustain the rejection of claim 1 and claims 10 and 16 which stand therewith. Claim 12 Appellants argue that \\u201c[c]laim 12 depends on independent claim 1 and is thus allowable over the proposed combination of Rockenfeller and Mori for at least the same reasons set forth earlier with respect to independent claim 1.\\u201d  App. Br. 14.  In support of this argument Appellants state that \\u201cthe Examiner has not and reasonably cannot rely upon the disclosure contained                                                            1 We note that claim 1 requires \\u201cdispersing heat generated from at least one of the secondary desorber and the secondary condenser through the heat exchanger.  App. Br. 20 (emphasis added).   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011197 Application 10/993,518  7 in Sarkisian to make up for the deficiencies discussed above with respect to Rockenfeller and Mori in the rejection of independent claim 1.\\u201d  Id. As we discern no deficiencies in the rejection of claim 1 as discussed supra, and Appellant has presented no other argument in favor of the patentability of claim 12, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 12. Claim 13 Appellants argue that \\u201c[c]laim 13 depends on independent claim 1 and is thus allowable over the proposed combination of Rockenfeller and Mori for at least the same reasons set forth earlier with respect to independent claim 1.\\u201d  App. Br. 15.  In support of this argument Appellants state that \\u201cthe Examiner has not and reasonably cannot rely upon the disclosure contained in Aikawa to make up for the deficiencies discussed above with respect to Rockenfeller and Mori in the rejection of independent claim 1.\\u201d  Id. As we discern no deficiencies in the rejection of claim 1 as discussed supra, and Appellant has presented no other argument in favor of the patentability of claim 13, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 13. Claims 17-22 and 29  Appellants argue claims 17-22 and 29 as a group.  See App. Br. 16-17.  We select independent claim 17 as the illustrative claim and claims 18-22 and 29stand or fall with claim 17.  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii) (2011). Appellants argue that \\u201cthe proposed combination of Rockenfeller and Mori fails to disclose that heat from at least one of a secondary desorber (G2) and a secondary condenser (C2) is dispersed outside of a triple effect cooling system.\\u201d  App. Br. 16; Reply Br. 9.  As discussed supra with respect to claim 1, Rockenfeller discloses these limitations.  Accordingly, we sustain \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011197 Application 10/993,518  8 the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 17 and 22 and claims 18-21 and 29 which depend therefrom.  Claim 32 Appellants argue that \\u201c[c]laim 32 depends on independent claim 22 and is thus allowable over the proposed combination of Rockenfeller, Mori, and Aikawa for at least the same reasons set forth earlier with respect to independent claim 22.\\u201d  App. Br. 17.  In support of this argument Appellants state that \\u201cthe Examiner has not and reasonably cannot rely upon the disclosure contained in Bass to make up for the deficiencies discussed above with respect to Rockenfeller, Mori, and Aikawa in the rejection of independent claim 22.\\u201d  Ans. 17-18.   As we discern no deficiencies in the rejection of claim 22 as discussed supra, and Appellant has presented no other argument in favor of the patentability of claim 32, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 32.  DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s rejections of claims 1, 10, 12, 13, 16-22 and 29 and 32 are AFFIRMED.

NEW, and HUNG H. BUI, Administrative Patent Judges.  Opinion by NEW, Administrative Patent Judge. Concurring opinion by TORCZON, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007722 Application 10/584,337   SUMMARY  Appellants file this appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from the Examiner\\u2019s Final Rejection of claims 8-14.1  Specifically, claims 8-10 and 12-14 stand rejected as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being obvious over Appellants\\u2019 Admitted Prior Art (\\u201cAAPA\\u201d) and Zafarana et al, (US 6,078,203, June 20, 2000) (\\u201cZafarana\\u201d).  Claim 11 stands rejected as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being obvious over the combination of AAPA, Zafarana, and Goldberg (US 3,714,470, January 30, 1973) (\\u201cGoldberg\\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b). We AFFIRM.  NATURE OF THE CLAIMED INVENTION Appellants\\u2019 invention is directed to a converter, comprising at least means for sensing the currents fed to the electric motor powered by the converter, the means for current detection being situated inside the converter, and the signals of the means being fed to a nonlinear filter, whose output signals are fed to an additional filter that is connected to an analog-to-digital converter.  Abstract.  GROUPING OF CLAIMS  Because Appellants make essentially the same arguments for claims 8-10 and 1-14 as they do for claim 11, we select claim 8 as representative of the claims on appeal.  See App. Br. 3, 7.  Claim 8 recites:                                            1  Claims 1-7 have been cancelled and are not on appeal.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007722 Application 10/584,337   8.  A converter, comprising:  a device adapted to sense currents fed to an electric motor powered by the converter, the device arranged inside the converter, signals of the device fed to a nonlinear filter, output signals of the nonlinear filter fed to an additional filter that is connected to an analog-to-digital converter.  Claims App\\u2019x 1.    ISSUE  Appellants argue that the Examiner erred in finding that an artisan of ordinary skill in the art would not be motivated to combine the teachings of Zafarana with the AAPA.  App. Br. 5, 6.  We therefore address the issue of whether the Examiner so erred.  ANALYSIS  Appellants argue that the AAPA teaches a device in which signals provided by a current-sensing device of control electronics are initially supplied to a filter, and the filtered measuring signals are then provided to a microcontroller to suppress interference signals.  App. Br. 4.  Appellants also contend that Zafarana teaches, inter alia, a voltage regulator, which has a linear filter, a comparator, and a stretcher filter, connected in series with one another between an input terminal and an output terminal of the regulator.  Id.  (citing Zafarana, col. 3, ll. 14-24).  According to Appellants, one of ordinary skill in the art following the teachings of Zafarana would understand that the output from a linear filter should be supplied to a comparator, and the output of the comparator should then be supplied to a \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007722 Application 10/584,337   stretcher filter.  App. Br. 5.  That, contend Appellants, is not the arrangement recited in claim 8, which does not teach that the output of the linear filter is connected in series to a comparator and a stretcher filter.  Id.  Appellants argue that Zafarana teaches that a linear filter alone is not sufficient to filter out a noise signal; rather, a comparator is needed to produce a square wave, and a stretcher filter is further required to suppress spurious comparator switchings.  App. Br. 5.  Moreover, argue Appellants, Zafarana also teaches a non-linear filtering section in order to completely remove spurious comparator switchings.  Id. (citing Zafarana, col. 5, ll. 25-29).  According to Appellants, Zafarana teaches that the non-linear filtering section is effective only because it is used in combination with the linear filter, comparator, and stretcher filter in series together.  App. Br. 5.  Consequently, argue Appellants, one of ordinary skill in the art \\u201cfollowing the disclosure of Zafarana\\u201d would not have been motivated to exclude the comparator and stretcher filter, since those elements are essential to the proper function of the Zafarana\\u2019s device.  Id.  The Examiner responds that Zafarana teaches that the linear filter, comparator, and stretcher filter are for suppressing spurious switchings to reduce the switching frequency of the linear filter-stretcher filter-comparator system, and that they do not have any effect on the output from the non-linear filter to the linear filter.  Ans. 9.  The Examiner finds that Zafarana teaches that \\u201cthe non-linear filter 7 provided is advantageous in that it reduces the noise amplitude at the input terminal I2 of the linear filter 2, irrespective of the alternator load and the engine rpm.\\u201d  Ans. 10 (quoting Zafarana, col. 4, ll. 33-36)(emphasis omitted).  The Examiner concludes that an artisan of ordinary skill interested in using the output of the linear \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007722 Application 10/584,337   filter, would have been motivated to remove Zafarana\\u2019s comparator, the stretcher filter, frequency reader, and frequency controller because those elements serve only to suppress spurious switchings to reduce the switching frequency of the linear filter/stretcher filter/comparator system.  Ans. 10 (citing Zafarana, col. 1, ll. 65- 67).  The Examiner also concludes that one of ordinary skill in the art would have known to exclude the comparator and stretcher filter of Zafarana because they do not serve the purpose of converting an analog signal into digital signal.  Ans. 10.  We are persuaded by the Examiner\\u2019s reasoning.  All elements of a prior art reference need not read on the claimed invention; rather, the proper test for obviousness is what the combined teachings of the prior art would have suggested to a person of ordinary skill in the art.  See In re Kotzab, 217 F.3d 1365, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  In the instant appeal, the Examiner relies upon the teachings of Zafarana to supply the \\u201csignals of the device fed to a nonlinear filter, output signals of the nonlinear filter fed to an additional filter\\u201d recited in claim 8.  It is not required that all elements of Zafarana\\u2019s series of non-linear filter, linear filter, comparator, and stretcher filter be incorporated when combined with AAPA, particularly since, as the Examiner finds, the comparator and stretcher filter do not distribute feedback to the non-linear or linear filters, and therefore do not influence, the output of the non-linear filter to the linear (\\u201cother\\u201d) filter.  Ans. 9.  We therefore discern no error in the Examiner\\u2019s findings and conclusion and we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 8.  Moreover, because Appellants rely upon the same reasoning with respect to dependent claims 9-14, we similarly affirm the rejection of those claims.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007722 Application 10/584,337   DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 8-14 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) is affirmed.  TIME PERIOD FOR RESPONSE No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1).  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iv).  AFFIRMED     \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007722 Application 10/584,337   TORCZON, Administrative Patent Judge, concurring.  I join with the majority in affirming the rejection, but write separately to note problems in the form of claim 8.  Specifically, claim 8 appears to run afoul of the prohibition on single-means claims.  See In re Hyatt, 708 F.2d 712, 714 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (explaining the long-standing prohibition), citing O'Reilly v. Morse, 56 U.S. 62, 112 (1853).  The Hyatt decision suggests that the proper rejection for such claims is an enablement rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112(a).  Additionally, claim 8 appears to be missing words needed to make grammatical sense.  Hyatt, 708 F.2d at 714 (applying the precepts of grammar to claims).  Presumably, the latter half of the claim should read (added words underlined): wherein signals of the device are fed to a nonlinear filter and output signals of the nonlinear filter are fed to an additional filter that is connected to an analog-to-digital converter. Other corrections are also possible, however, which suggests that a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) for indefiniteness is also warranted.  In the event that the appellant further prosecutes an amended version of claim 8, these section 112 defects should be corrected.  Although the claim is defective under section 112, it is nevertheless possible to review a prior art rejection if the prior art teaches or suggests an embodiment within the uncontested scope of the claim.  Ex parte Tanksley, 26 SPQ2d 1384, 1387 (BPAI 1991).  The rejection as the majority analyzes it above appears to be facially reasonable.  Although the Appellant argues that a person having ordinary skill in the art would not substitute the analog-to-digital converter 2 of the disclosed prior art for Zafarana's comparator-stretcher filter (which produces a square wave), argument is not evidence.  The fact that Zafarana uses the non-linear/linear filters for noise \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007722 Application 10/584,337   reduction in one circuit does not in itself teach away from using the same combination of filters for the same purpose in a different circuit.  Consequently, because the appellant has not shown prejudicial error in the prior art rejection, I join with the majority in affirming the reject, despite my concerns about the claim form.

(US 2004/0143603 Al, Jul. 22, 2004) (Ans. 4).\\n\\nANALYSIS\\n\\nWith regard to claim 1, Appellants argue that \\u201cKazgfmamr does not\\ndisclose . . . navigation control wl1icl1 allows the user to select any of the\\ncurrently presented meeting content and an arbitrary previously presented\\nmeeting content, and present these to the user during the live meeting\\u201d\\n(App. Br. 8). We agree for the reasons set forth in the Appeal Brief (id. at 8-\\n14).\\n\\nWith regard to claim 6, Appellants argue that \\u201cKaufmann does not\\ndisclose . . . the simultaneous presentation ofa current audio signal and a\\npreviously recorded signal during a live meeting to a user\\u201d (id. at 16\\n\\n(emphasis omitted)). We agree for the reasons set forth in the Appeal Brief\\n\\n(id. at 16-17).Appeal 2011-010117\\nApplication 12/128,105\\n\\nIn response to both arguments, the Examiner notes:\\n\\nKaufmann discloses an_exe111plary system that provides real-\\ntime as well as the more traditional post-hoc editing of the\\nrecording. Editing (i.e. the displayed/presented steam content)\\ncan be done during a live session, while (i.e., at the sa111e time\\nor simultaneous) the system is recording, or after the recording\\nhas been completed. For example, in. one implementation, the\\nrecording is displayed as it was recorded during the live session\\nwith main l30l and mini views l302.\\n\\n(Ans. 9-10.) The Examiner also notes that \\u201csaid exemplary system provides\\nan easy way to quickly retrieve events with random access that were\\nrecorded during a live session\" (id. at 10). We are not persuaded.\\n\\nKaufmann discloses that, \\u201c[i]n one implementation, the recording is\\ndisplayed as it was recorded during the live session with main 1301 and mini\\nviews 1302\\u201d (Kaufmann, ll [01 l7]). Kaufmann also discloses that the\\n\\u201cexemplary system provides an easy way to quickly retrieve events with\\nrandom access that were recorded during a live session\\u201d (id. at 11 [O05l]).\\nHowever, neither of these teachings concern presenting previously recorded\\nmaterial during a live meeting.\\n\\nIn addition, Kaufmann discloses that the \\u201cexemplary system provides\\nreal-time as well as the 111ore traditional post-hoc editing of the recording\\u201d\\nand that \\u201c[e]diting can be done during a live session, while the system is\\nrecording, or after the recording l1as been completed\\u201d (id. at 1] [0054]).\\nHowever, we do not agree with the Examiner that this teaching discloses the\\n\\ndisputed features of claims l and 6.Appeal 2011-010117\\nApplication 12/128,105\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe Examiner has not set forth a prima facie case that Kaufinann\\nanticipates Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention.

A method comprising:\\n\\nreceiving information from a network of seismic devices deployed\\nat geographic locations where the seismic devices perform seismic\\nacquisition of data relating to a subterranean structure;\\n\\ngenerating a graphical representation of tl1e network of seismic\\ndevices deployed at geographic locations where the seismic\\ndevices perform seismic acquisition of data, the graphical\\nrepresentation containing information regarding the seismic\\ndevices, wherein generating the graphical representation comp\\ufb01ses\\ngenerating the graphical representation having plural layers to\\nrepresent different logical groups of seismic devices;\\n\\ndepicting the plural layers using different colors; and\\n\\npresenting alarms associated with at least some of the seismic\\ndevices in the graphical representation, wherein presenting the\\nalarms comprises using different symbols within each of the layers\\nto indicate different types of alan11s associated with the individual\\nseismic devices in the corresponding layer.\\n\\nThe references of record which are being relied on by the Examiner as\\n\\nevidence of obviousness are:\\n\\nElder et al.

(Pavel) US 2008/Ol 14548 Al May 15, 2008Appeal 201 1-002420\\nApplication 11/754,125\\n\\nTHE REJECTIONS\\nClaims 1 through 3, 5, 6, 9 through 13, 17 through 19, and 22 through\\n34 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a) as the subject matter claimed\\ntherein would have been obvious at the time Appellants 111ade their invention\\n\\nfrom the disclosure of Elder considered with Pavel.\\n\\nOPINION\\n\\nWe \\ufb01nd the Examiner has 1nade out a prima facie case of obviousness\\nwith respect to the subject matter claimed by Appellants essentially for the\\nreasons well-expressed by the Examiner in his Answer. We also \\ufb01nd that\\nAppellants have failed to successfully rebut the prima facie case, either by\\npersuasive argument or by the presentation of evidence of unobviousness.\\nWe add the following comments for clarity and for emphasis.\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 fundamental argument for why the claimed subject matter\\nwould not have been considered to be obvious at the time they made their\\ninvention is founded on their allegation that Elder does not disclose the\\nclai1n limitation \\u201cpresenting alarms associated with at least some of the\\nseis111ic devices in the graphical representation.\\u201d Additionally, Appellants\\nargue that while Pavel does disclose presenting alarms in a seismic data\\nacquisition system, Pavel does not disclose or suggest presenting alarms in a\\ngraphical representation of the seismic system. We do not find either of\\nAppellants\\u2019 arguments to be persuasive.\\n\\nThe only disclosure found in Appellants\\u2019 Speci\\ufb01cation describing the\\nmeaning of the term \\u201calarms\\u201d may be found in paragraph [0023] on pages 6\\n\\nand 7; and paragraphs [0024] and [0025] on page 7 of the Speci\\ufb01cation.Appeal 201 1-002420\\nApplication 11/754,125\\n\\nTherein, in paragraph [0023], Appellants disclose that \\u201cthe geographic\\ninformation package is able to represent information relating to the states of\\nvarious seismic devices\\u201d and that \\u201cthe states can include alarms associated\\nwitl1 the seismic devices, witl1 the alarms including different types of\\nalarms.\\u201d ln paragraph [0024], Appellants disclose that:\\n\\nln one example, one type of alan11 can be associated with\\n\\nseismic sensors, another type of alarm can be associated with\\n\\nconnnunications devices, and so forth. The different alarm\\n\\ntypes are thus associated with different logical layers, such that\\n\\na user can easily view different information in the different\\n\\nlogical layers. ln one i111ple111entation, the different logical\\n\\nlayers can have different colors, so that a user can quickly\\n\\nascertain the states associated with seis111ic devices in the\\n\\nspread, which eases analysis of a complex spread.\\nln paragraph [0025], Appellants disclose that \\u201cthe geographic representation\\npresented by the geographic infomiation package can indicate the severity of\\neach alarm condition by using different rendering symbols.\\u201d\\n\\nAccordingly, based on these disclosures, we agree with the\\nExaminer\\u2019s \\ufb01nding that Elder is evidence that it was known at the time\\nAppellants 111ade their invention to present the status of seismic devices\\ndeployed in a seismic system by presentation of \\u201calarms\\u201d as the term is\\ndefined by Appellants in a graphical representation of the seis111ic system\\ncontaining information regarding the seismic devices. Indeed, we \\ufb01nd Elder\\nto be evidence of the obviousness of the claimed subject matter without the\\nneed to rely on Pavel.

DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING  STATEMENT OF THE CASE Appellants filed a Request for Rehearing under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.52 from our Decision on Appeal.  Req. Reh\\u2019g, p. 1.1  In the Decision, we                                            1 Throughout this Opinion, we refer to the Examiner\\u2019s Answer mailed June 25, 2010 (\\u201cAns.\\u201d), Reply Brief filed August 23, 2010 (\\u201cReply Br.\\u201d),  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   2reversed the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 1, 2, 5, 7, 10-16, 17, 18, 30, 33, 35, 38-43, 45, 47, 48, 50, 53-59, 64-67, 76, and 78-83 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102 as anticipated by Killen (U.S. Patent Application Publication No.: U.S. 2004/0088650 A1), but pursuant to our authority under 37 C.F.R.  \\xa7 41.50(b), rejected claims 1, 7, and 14 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103 as obvious over Killen and Appellants\\u2019 background art.  Decision, pp. 6-8.  According to Appellants, we erred by making unsupported findings as to the skill in the art.  See e.g., Req. Reh\\u2019g, pp. 7-9 (alleging we presented \\u201cmere conclusory statements\\u201d).  Having reviewed our decision in light of the alleged errors, we maintain the Decision on Appeal. CLAIM 1 Claim 1 is reproduced below.  1.  A method for processing cells in a spreadsheet, the method comprising: displaying a spreadsheet, said spreadsheet including a plurality of cells, some of said cells containing data and some of said cells containing formulas; in response to user selection of a root cell of said spreadsheet, said root cell containing a root formula, displaying said root formula in said root cell; determining a dependency chain for said root cell, said dependency chain including at least one input cell and at least one intermediate cell between said input cell and said root cell,                                                                                                                               Decision on Appeal mailed July 29, 2013 (\\u201cDecision\\u201d), and Request for Rehearing filed September 25, 2013 (\\u201cReq. Reh\\u2019g\\u201d). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   3said at least one intermediate cell containing an intermediate formula; automatically consolidating said intermediate formula and said root formula to provide a consolidated formula; and storing the consolidated formula in a single cell. Appellants characterize our at-issue determinations as relying on mere conclusory findings and impermissible hindsight of Appellants\\u2019 invention.  Req. Reh\\u2019g, pp. 3-7.  By example, Appellants argue: There is nothing in either Killen or Appellants[\\u2019] cited background, even in combination, that suggests \\u201cdetermining a dependency chain for said root cell, said dependency chain including at least one input cell and at least one intermediate cell between said input cell and said root cell, said at least one intermediate cell containing an intermediate formula.\\u201d  (Claim 1).  There is nothing in either Killen or Appellant[s\\u2019] cited background, even in combination, that suggests \\u201cautomatically consolidating said intermediate formula and said root formula to provide a consolidated formula; and storing the consolidated formula in a single cell\\u201d (Claim 1).  According to the Decision, \\u2018\\u2018[t]he issue, therefore, is whether skilled artisans would have [. . . ] understood a benefit and process of consolidating such incorporated, interdependent spreadsheet formulas.\\u201d  (Decision, p. 7).  The answer to this can only be affirmative if impermissible hindsight is used. As demonstrated, neither of the citations mention or suggest any consolidation of interdependent spreadsheet formulas.  The only suggestion of such consolidation on the record comes from Appellant[s\\u2019] own specification.  This being the case, it is also necessarily true that neither of the citations mention or suggest any benefit from such consolidation of interdependent spreadsheet formulas.  Again, the description of the benefits from consolidation comes solely from Appellant[s\\u2019] own specification. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   4The new ground of rejection appears to make an unreasonable logical leap.  The Decision starts with the idea that (1) a formula in one spreadsheet cell may use, as an input, the output of another formula in another cell, and, from there, arrives at the claim reciting (2) all of: determining a dependency chain for said root cell, said dependency chain including at least one input cell and at least one intermediate cell between said input cell and said root cell, said at least one intermediate cell containing an intermediate formula;  automatically consolidating said intermediate formula and said root formula to provide a consolidated formula; and storing the consolidated formula in a single cell.  (Claim 1). Req. Reh\\u2019g, pp. 5-6.   We separately address, below, Appellants\\u2019 arguments as to the claimed dependency chain (see above-quoted \\u201cdetermining\\u201d step) and claimed consolidation (see above-quoted \\u201cconsolidating\\u201d and \\u201cstoring\\u201d steps).  Claimed Dependency Chain Contrary to Appellants\\u2019 recapitulation of the Decision (supra, p. 3), we did not determine that the claimed dependency chain (see \\u201cdetermining\\u201d step) would have been obvious in light of a known benefit of consolidating interrelated/interdependent spreadsheet formulas.  Rather, we found that Killen teaches the claimed dependency chain for the reasons expressed by the Examiner\\u2019s Answer, stating: \\u201cFor the reasons presented within the rejection of claim 1, we find (and Appellants do not dispute) that Killen \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   5teaches all but the claimed consolidating.\\u201d).  Decision, p. 6; see also Ans., p. 4 (citing Killen, Figs. 5 and 7 as teaching the claimed dependency chain).   Appellants\\u2019 Reply Brief acknowledged that Killen teaches the claimed dependency chain, but argued that Killen fails to teach the claimed consolidation, stating:  Killen merely teaches that the formula of one cell references intermediate cells with intermediate formulas, which in turn reference other cells.  (See Killen, Fig. 7).  However, a reference in a root formula to a cell implementing an intermediate formula is not the same as a consolidation of the intermediate formula itself into the root formula.  (See, e.g., claim 1).   Reply Br., p. 9.  Now, Appellants similarly acknowledge that Killen teaches the claimed dependency chain, but again argue that Killen fails to teach the claimed consolidation, stating:  According to the Decision, \\u201cAppellants\\u2019 background discussion of the invention evidences skilled artisans would have understood that incorporated spreadsheet formulas (i.e., incorporated within a single cell by reference) sometimes \\u2018interrelate\\u2019 and \\u2018contain Interdependencies\\u2019 (Spec., \\xb6 2).\\u201d This appears duplicative of Killen\\u2019s teachings.  Together, these citations merely show that a formula in one spreadsheet cell may use, as an input, the output of another formula in another cell.  This does not rise to the subject matter recited in claim 1.   Req. Reh\\u2019g, p. 4. Even assuming arguendo the above arguments do not acknowledge that Killen teaches the claimed dependency chain for the reasons expressed by the Answer (Decision, p. 6), Appellants plainly agree that Killen teaches \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   6a \\u201cformula of one cell [that] references intermediate cells with intermediate formulas, which in turn reference other cells.\\u201d  Reply Br., p. 9 (citing Killen, Fig. 7) (block quoted at supra p. 4).  We do not see \\u2013 and Appellants have not meaningfully explained \\u2013 why the acknowledged interrelationship/interdependency of spread sheet cells and their formulas fails to teach or suggest the claimed dependency chain (as opposed to the claimed consolidation).  Accordingly, Appellants\\u2019 argument (or lack thereof) as to the claimed dependency chain is unpersuasive.  See In re Jung, 637 F.3d 1356, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (\\u201cBefore the examiner, Jung merely argued that the claims differed from [applied prior art], and chose not to proffer a serious explanation of this difference.\\u201d); see also 37 C.F.R.  \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii) (\\u201cA statement which merely points out what a claim recites will not be considered an argument for separate patentability of the claim.\\u201d).   Claimed Consolidation Also contrary to Appellants\\u2019 recapitulation of the Decision (supra, p. 3), we did not make a \\u201clogical leap\\u201d in determining that the claimed consolidation would have been obvious over Killen and Appellants\\u2019 background art.  Rather, we held that an ordinarily skilled artisan would have known that a spreadsheet cell formula sometimes references interrelated/interdependent formulas of other cells and, further, would have had a common sense understanding that interrelated/interdependent formulas can sometimes be consolidated by formula substitutions and then simplified by cancellations of formula terms (just as interrelated/interdependent formulas have long been consolidated and simplified in other settings, e.g., high school algebra).  We particularly held: \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   7Killen\\u2019s Figure 5 spreadsheet has cells that singularly incorporate multiple formulas by reference, e.g., cited cell \\u201cE5\\u201d incorporates two summations by reference to cells \\u201cE3\\u201d and \\u201cE4.\\u201d  Though the spreadsheet\\u2019s particular formulas do not lend themselves to consolidation, Appellants\\u2019 background discussion of the invention evidences skilled artisans would have understood that incorporated spreadsheet formulas (i.e., incorporated within a single cell by reference) sometimes \\u201cinterrelate\\u201d and \\u201ccontain interdependencies\\u201d (Spec., \\xb6 2).  The issue, therefore, is whether skilled artisans would have further understood a benefit and process of consolidating such incorporated, interdependent spreadsheet formulas. The benefits of consolidating interdependent formulas \\u2013 e.g., easier computation and comprehension \\u2013 have been generally understood since long before Appellants\\u2019 invention.  And, the processes of consolidating interdependent formulas \\u2013 e.g., substitution and cancellation of terms \\u2013 have been likewise understood.  Given these understandings, it would have been obvious to ease the user\\u2019s comprehension of Killen\\u2019s spreadsheet (or any other spreadsheet) by consolidating incorporated, interdependent cell formulas.   Decision, pp. 6-7 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).  In light of the above explanation of our holding, we did not engage in a \\u201clogical leap.\\u201d  Rather, we fully bridged a gap between the claimed consolidation and Killen\\u2019s teachings by explicitly articulating both an understanding of spreadsheet formulas expressed by Appellants\\u2019 background art discussion (i.e., spreadsheet formulas were known to, at times, be interrelated/interdependent) and a common sense understanding of formulae consolidation and simplification. As a factfinder, we may infer common sense understandings of an ordinarily skilled artisan and may, in turn, determine whether a claimed invention would have been obvious in light of that inferred common sense \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   8understanding of the art.  See e.g., KSR Int\\u2019l. Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 420 (2007) (\\u201cCommon sense teaches . . . that familiar items may have obvious uses beyond their primary purposes[.]\\u201d); id. at 421 (\\u201cRigid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense, however, are neither necessary under our case law nor consistent with it.\\u201d).  Similarly, it is axiomatic that an Examiner\\u2019s reasoning \\u201cmay include recourse to logic, judgment, and common sense available to the person of ordinary skill that do not necessarily require explication in any reference or expert opinion.\\u201d  Perfect Web Techs., Inc. v. InfoUSA, Inc., 587 F.3d 1324, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see also In re Bozek, 416 F.2d 1385, 1390 (CCPA 1969) (\\u201c[An examiner may rely upon] common knowledge and common sense of the person of ordinary skill in the art without any specific hint or suggestion in a particular reference[.]\\u201d) (citations omitted).  Of course, we may not make a merely conclusory determination that a claimed feature is \\u201ccommon sense.\\u201d  See e.g., Mintz v. Dietz & Watson, Inc., 679 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (\\u201c[T]he mere recitation of the words \\u2018common sense\\u2019 without any support adds nothing to the obviousness equation.\\u201d); KSR, 550 U.S. at 418 (\\u201c[R]ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere conclusory statements[.]\\u201d (quoting In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).  However, for the reasons explained above, we have not made a merely conclusory determination. Turning back to Appellants\\u2019 arguments (see block quote, supra, pp. 3-4), Appellants acknowledge an ordinarily skilled artisan would have understood that \\u201cincorporated spreadsheet formulas . . . sometimes \\u2018interrelate\\u2019 and \\u2018contain Interdependencies\\u2019\\u201d (Req. Reh\\u2019g, p. 4), but argue \\u201c[t]here is nothing in either Killen or Appellant[s\\u2019] cited background that \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   9mentions or even suggests consolidating root and intermediate formulae\\u201d (id. at p. 5).  The argument neglects our wholly different determination that the claimed consolidation would have been obvious over Killen because skilled artisans: (i) understood, in view of Appellants\\u2019 background art discussion, that a spreadsheet cell may reference interrelated/interdependent formulas; and (ii) understood, in view of common sense, that interrelated/interdependent formulas can be desirably consolidated by substitution and then simplified by cancellations of terms.  See supra, pp. 6-7.  Appellants have not submitted arguments and/or evidence to show an error in our underlying findings of fact (i) and (ii) or an error in our reasoning used to reach the obviousness determination from these findings.  See Ex Parte Frye, 94 USPQ2d 1072, 1075 (BPAI 2010) (precedential) (explaining the Board\\u2019s standard of review). In light of the foregoing, we decline to modify our decision to newly reject claim 1 as obvious over Killen and Appellants\\u2019 background art. CLAIM 7 Claim 7 recites: \\u201cThe method of claim 1 further comprising highlighting cells in said dependency chain for said root cell responsive to the user input selecting the root cell.\\u201d  With respect to claim 7, we determined: [I]t is common sense to highlight the intermediary cells referenced by a selected cell, particularly so as to ease the user\\u2019s identification of the selected cell\\u2019s incorporated contents. See KSR, 550 U.S. at 421 (\\u201cRigid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense, however, are neither necessary under our case law nor consistent with it.\\u201d). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   10Decision, pp. 7-8.  In response to the above determination, Appellants argue that we presented merely a \\u201cbald conclusion\\u201d based on reconstructive hindsight knowledge of Appellants\\u2019 invention.  Req. Reh\\u2019g, pp. 7-8.   Contrary to Appellants\\u2019 argument, we did not present a \\u201cbald conclusion\\u201d that the claimed highlighting would have been a common sense improvement over Killen\\u2019s teachings.  Rather, we found that it is common sense to highlight things of interest for easier identification.  In turn, we determined that it would have been obvious to highlight the referenced cells of a selected cell (e.g., a selected root cell), such that the spreadsheet user can more easily identify the referenced cells.2  For example, if cell \\u201cE5\\u201d of Killen\\u2019s Figure 5 spreadsheet were selected, it would be obvious to highlight cells \\u201cE3\\u201d and \\u201cE4,\\u201d such that the user can quickly identify which cell values are being summed by the selected cell value E5 = SUM (E3:E4). Also contrary to Appellants\\u2019 argument, the above determination is not a hindsight reconstruction of Appellants\\u2019 invention; that is, does not \\u201cimbue one of ordinary skill in the art with knowledge of the invention.\\u201d  Req. Reh\\u2019g, p. 6 (quoting W.L. Gore & Assoc. v. Garlock, Inc., 721 F.2d 1540, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (emphasis added)).  Rather, the determination is based upon our clear findings as to what an ordinarily skilled artisan would have understood without prior knowledge of Appellants\\u2019 invention.  Cf., Random House Webster\\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary 1159 (2d ed. 2001) (defining \\u201cimbue\\u201d as \\u201cto impregnate or inspire, as with feelings, opinions, etc.\\u201d).  The determination is particularly based on our findings that, being someone with common sense, an ordinarily skilled artisan would consider: (i) highlighting                                            2 We note claim 7 does not require highlighting of all dependency chain cells in response to the selection of a dependency chain\\u2019s root cell.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   11things of interest to ease their identification; and (ii) understand that referenced cells of a selected cell are of interest to a spreadsheet user.  Appellants have not submitted arguments and/or evidence to show an error in our underlying findings of fact (i) and (ii) or an error in our reasoning used to reach the obviousness determination from these findings.  See Frye, 94 USPQ2d at 1075. In light of the foregoing, we decline to modify our decision to newly reject claim 7 as obvious over Killen and Appellants\\u2019 background art. CLAIM 14 Claim 14 recites: \\u201cThe method of claim 1 including: determining whether the intermediate cell is referenced by a cell other than the root cell; and if the intermediate cell is referenced by a cell other than the root cell, generating an alert to a user.\\u201d  This subject matter encompasses a mere alert for protecting referenced cells from deletion.  In the context of base claim 1, the alert particularly prevents the spreadsheet user from unknowingly deleting an intermediary cell that is referenced by another cell (but is no longer referenced by the consolidated root cell, as now simplified but still under selection).   In addressing this subject matter, we found: \\u201c[I]t is common sense to alert the user of referenced intermediary cells after consolidation of the root cell, particularly because they are still needed and thus their deletion should be prevented.\\u201d  Decision, p. 8.  In response, Appellants argue: None of [the above finding] has been demonstrated in the cited references.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   12As with claim 7 above, the Decision dismisses claim 14 as \\u201ccommon sense\\u201d without any supporting citation to any reference. Req. Reh\\u2019g, p. 9 (citation omitted).   Contrary to Appellants\\u2019 argument, common sense findings need not be supported by citation to a prior art reference.  They need only be articulated and reasonable.  See Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH v. Lupin, Ltd., 499 F.3d 1293, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (\\u201cIt remains necessary to show some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness, but such reasoning need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim.\\u201d) (quoting In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (inner quotation marks omitted) and applying KSR)).  As required, we reasonably and explicitly found an ordinarily skilled artisan would have understood, as a matter of common sense, that: (i) a referenced cell value is needed by its referencing computation; and (ii) that a spreadsheet user should be aware, and thus alerted, of an impending deletion of needed subject matter.  These findings cannot be deemed conclusory for mere lack of a supporting prior art citation of record.  See KSR, 550 U.S. at 418 (\\u201c[A]nalysis need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim, for a court can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ.\\u201d).  And, Appellants have not submitted arguments and/or evidence to show an error in our underlying findings of fact (i) and (ii), or an error in our reasoning used to reach the obviousness determination from these findings.  See Frye, 94 USPQ2d at 1075. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-001886 Application 10/960,254   13In light of the foregoing, we decline to modify our decision to newly reject claim 14 as obvious over Killen and Appellants\\u2019 background art. CONCLUSION In view of the foregoing discussion, we decline to modify our decision on Appeal.  Consequently, we deny Appellants\\u2019 Request for Rehearing with respect to making any changes therein.

A method of managing resources of a controlled device, the\\n\\nmethod comprising:\\n\\nmonitoring, by the controlled device, an invocation of an action\\nrepresenting a connection of a control point for a predetermined time;\\n\\ndetermining whether the control point is connected to the controlled\\ndevice based on whether the action is invoked; and\\n\\nincreasing available resources by selectively deactivating an\\napplication which is controlled by the control point according to a result of\\nthe determining.\\n\\nREFERENCES and REJECTIONS\\n\\nThe Examiner rejected claims 13-18 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) based\\nupon the teachings of UPnP (Non-Patent Publication \\u201cUPnPTM Device\\nArchitecture 1.0,\\u201d ver. 1.0.1 (December 3, 20038).\\n\\nThe Examiner rejected claims 1-3, 5-9, ll, and 12 under 35 U.S.C.\\n\\xa7 l03(a) based upon the teachings of Sparrell (US Pat.

Pub.\\n2005/0286427 A1, Dec. 29, 2005).\\n\\nANALYSIS\\nRcfjeclion ofclaims I3-I8 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 I()2(b)\\n\\nThe Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 13-18 states the step of \\u201cinvoking\\nan action . . . at predetermined times\\u201d is taught by UPnP pages 18-19 which\\nrecites the \\u201ccontrol point send[s] a multicast request to connect with\\ncontrolled devices and waits at least the amount of time speci\\ufb01ed in the MX\\nheader for responses to arrive\\u201d (emphasis omitted) (Ans. 5). The Examiner\\nfurther \\ufb01nds the step of the control point invoking an action representing \\u201ca\\nconnection is selectively terminated\\u201d is taught on page 16 ofUPnP, which\\nstates \\u201cwhen a device and its services are going to be removed from the\\nnetwork, the device should multicast a ssdp:byebye message\\u201d (emphasis\\nomitted) (Ans. 5).\\n\\nAppellants contend UPnP does not send a multicast request at\\npredetermined times and therefore cannot invoke an action at predetermined\\ntimes (App. Br. 9). Additionally, the Examiner\\u2019s reliance on error code 612\\n(UPnP, page 51) does not teach selectively terminating a connection (App.\\nBr. 9). Rather, UPnP teaches a session may l1aVe expired and if so a control\\npoint opens a new session. Appellants contend this is not the same as\\nselectively terminating (App. Br. 9). We agree witl1 Appellants\\u2019 contentions.\\n\\nFirst, we note the Examiner is using an obviousness type analysis for\\nan anticipation rejection (see, e.g., Ans. 15, l6\\u2014\\u201cone of ordinary skill in the\\nart\\u201d; \\u201cimply\\u201d). With respect to the Examiner\\u2019s analysis, we note that to\\n\\nestablish inherent anticipation, \\u201c[t]he mere fact that a certain thing mayAppeal 2011-012662\\nApplication 12/ 143,946\\n\\nresult from a given set of circumstances is not sufficient.\\u201d In re Robertson,\\n169 F.3d 743, 745, (Fed. Cir. l999). The Examiner has not shown UPnP\\nnecessarily teaches Appellants\\u2019 clai111ed method.\\n\\nRejection ofclaimx I-12 under 35 US. C. \\xa7 103\\n\\nWith respect to independent claims 1 and 7, these claims recite\\nsubstantially the sa111e limitations argued above. The Examiner cites Sparrell\\nas disclosing \\u201cincreasing available resources by selectively deactivating an\\napplication which is controlled by the control point according to a result of\\nthe determining\\u201d (Ans. 8).\\n\\nAppellants assert Sparrell teaches warning a user of a con\\ufb02ict and\\ngiving the user an option to terminate a pre-existing media pipeline (App.\\nBr. l3; Reply Br. 10; Sparrell 11 [0l50]). Additionally, Appellants assert that\\nterminating a live session when the live session and that a pre-existing media\\npipeline are scheduled to use the same resources, as disclosed by Sparrell, is\\n\\u201cunrelated to whether the control point is connected to the controlled device\"\\n(App. Br. 13; Reply Br. 10). We agree.\\n\\nFurther, the Examiner\\u2019s response in the Answer is confusing as to\\nwhich claims the Examiner is referring. Such conjecture on our part as to\\nwhich \\ufb01ndings apply to which claims would require us to resort to\\nspeculation, unfounded assumptions, or hindsight reconstruction. See In re\\nWarner, 379 F.2d l0l 1, l0] 7 (CCPA 1967). \\u201cThe review authorized by 35\\nU.S.C.

Reply Br. 3. The procedural propriety of tlie Examiner\\u2019s\\nAnswer is a petitionable matter over which we do not have jurisdiction. See\\nMPEP 1207.03(lV). We note that the Exan1iner\\u2019s substantive analysis was\\n\\nmade in response to Appellants\\u2019 argument in the Appeal Brief that the\\n\\n3 The rejections of claims 1-5, 7-13, 17, 18, 20, 22-25, and 28-29 under\\n\\n35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(a) as being anticipated by Laborde et al.

The Appellants then availed themselves of the opportunity to\\nrespond in the Reply Brief. Because the Appellants did not \\ufb01le a timely\\npetition, we will address the analysis as presented in the Examiner\\u2019s Answer.\\n\\nThe rejection ofclaimx 1-5, 7-13, 17, 18, 20, 22-25, 28, and 30\\nas cmlicipaled by Garland\\n\\nThe Examiner \\ufb01nds that Appellants\\u2019 Speci\\ufb01cation describes \\u201cthe\\nphrase \\u2018data object\\u2019 to correspond to \\u2018groups of related data/infon11ation\\nstored in a memory,\\u201d and concludes that a person having ordinary skill in the\\nart at the time of the invention would \\u201cfairly and reasonably recognize\\u201d that\\nthe term \\u201cdata object\\u201d includes\\n\\nany and all structures or actions that one of ordinary skill in the\\nart at the time the invention was made would recognize as being\\nany grouping or collection of data/information that is somehow\\nrelated to other data/information within the collection.\\n\\nAns. 17. Using this claim construction, the Examiner further \\ufb01nds that\\nGarland\\u2019s disclosure of \\u201c[21] first collection of one or 111ore data \\ufb01les\\ncontaining data elements produced by a plurality of different test\\nmanagement tools\\u201d are \\u201cequivalent to the claimed \\u2018data object[\\u2019] and hence\\nare a \\u2018plurality of data objects\\u2019.\\u201d Id. at 19. The Examiner also \\ufb01nds that the\\n\\u201cfiles or \\u2018data objects\\u2019 of test data information as taught by [Garland] are in\\nfact stored in a suitable type of memory within the computer implemented\\nmachine/process.\\u201d Id. at 20.\\n\\nAppellants respond that \\u201cdata objects in memory\\u201d as recited in claim\\n1 \\u201cis a data structure held in transient storage.\\u201d Reply Br. 5. Appellants\\n\\nassert that the term \\u201cfile\\u201d used in Garland \\u201cis commonly understood to be aAppeal 2011-002877\\nApplication 1 l/345,048\\n\\nblock of information stored in non\\u2014transient storage.\\u201d Ia\\u2019. Appellants further\\nargue that equating a \\u201cdata object\\u201d with a \\u201cfile\\u201d would eliminate\\ndifferentiation between the claim terms, because\\n\\nclaim 1 itself makes a distinction between \\u201ca data object\" and\\n\\u201ca file.\\u201d That is, claim 1 recites \\u201ccreating a plurality of data\\nobjects in memory\\u201d, \\u201caccessing ones of the data objects and\\ndata in the memory\\u201d, and then \\u201cwriting the formatted data to a\\nfile.\\u201d The EXaminer\\u2019s constructions of appellants\\u2019 ten11s would\\ncollapse the bolded structures in the above excerpt into one\\nstructure, and would eliminate any differentiation of these\\nterms. Appellants assert that these terms have different plain\\nmeanings in the art, and the Of\\ufb01ce must give deference to these\\n\\ndifferent meanings.\\n\\nReply Br. 5-6. Appellants argue that Garland\\u2019s \\u201cfiles\\u201d are not \\u201cdata objects\\nin memory,\\u201d and that \\u201ceven when one of Garland\\u2019s files is read, there is no\\nindication by Garland that a data object corresponding to a logical grouping\\nof data implied by an event is created in memory.\\u201d Id. at 5.\\nThe Speci\\ufb01cation describes one embodiment of the claimed method,\\n\\nwith reference to Figure l, as including the steps of each data formatter\\n\\u201caccessing ones of the data objects and data stored in the memory (at step\\n\\nl08), formatting the data in accord with rules maintained by the data\\n\\n77\\n\\nforrnatter (at step 110), and writing the formatted data to a file (at step ll2).\\nSpec. [00l9]. The Speci\\ufb01cation discloses that\\n\\n[t]o reduce the number of data obj ects that is maintained in the\\nmemory 212, the data populator 200 may monitor reservations\\nof the data objects, and may delete data objects that are no\\nlonger reserved by any object or process that references or\\naccesses the data objects. In one embodiment, a data object is\\nconsidered reserved when a pointer is generated to reference the\\ndata object. . . . As pointers are generated, a count of the\\nnumber of pointers that reference a particular data object may\\nbe maintained (possibly within the data object itself). The dataAppeal 201 l-002877\\nApplication 1 l/345,048\\n\\nformatters 202, 204, 206, 208 and other processes can then be\\nprogrammed to relinquish their pointer to a data object when\\nthey have \\ufb01nished accessing the data object. and the data\\npopulator 200 can delete the data object when all such pointers\\nhave been released.\\n\\nId. at [0040]. The Speci\\ufb01cation teaches that there are a number of\\nadvantages to processing data using data objects in memory, including\\nincreasing the efficiency of data formatting:\\n\\nFor example, by providing a separate process to organize data\\nin memory, and then making the data available to a plurality of\\ndata for111atters, 111uch of the overhead of having to read and\\norganize data is removed from the data formatters; and, by\\ncreating data objects \\u201cin memory\", they can be accessed more\\nquickly than data stored on disk. This enables the code of the\\ndata formatters to be lighter weight, and also provides a\\nstandard data model that can be leveraged by new data\\nformatters.\\n\\nId. at [0044]. The Speci\\ufb01cation further teaches that the transience of the\\ndata objects in memory is essential to increasing that ef\\ufb01ciency:\\n\\nThe data models disclosed herein, and the manner in which data\\nis populated and removed fro111 them, also help to balance 1)\\nthe speed with which a plurality of data formatters can format a\\ncommon data set (i.e., they can each format the data of the data\\nset in parallel), with 2) the real\\u2014world limitations on memory,\\nstorage and/or processing resources. In the realm of the circuit\\ntest. and particularly when conducting parametric tests using an\\nSOC tester. so much data is generated that resource limitations\\nof even a well-provisioned computer system can be reached\\nafter testing as few as 10-20 chips. However, by using the data\\nmodels disclosed herein, and removing data objects that are no\\nlonger needed, resource li111itations can typically be avoided.\\n\\n1d. at [0045]Appeal 2011-002877\\nApplication 11/345,048\\n\\nThus, when the clai111 language is read in light of the Speci\\ufb01cation,\\nclaim l requires that the method include data structures held in transient\\nstorage (\\u201cdata objects\\u201d) in order to create fon11atted data to be held in non-\\ntransient storage (\\u201ca \\ufb01le\"). Therefore, in order to anticipate the claims,\\nGarland must disclose a method that includes these elements. See, e.g., Net\\nM0neyIN, Inc. v. VeriSign, Inc., 545 F.3d 1359, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2008)\\n(\\u201c[U]nless a reference discloses within the four corners of the document not\\nonly all of the li111itations claimed but also all of the limitations arranged or\\ncombined in the same way as recited in the claim, it cannot be said to prove\\nprior invention of the thing claimed and, thus, cannot anticipate under\\n35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102.\\u201d).\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 arguments are supported by the record. The Examiner\\ndoes not identify a data structure held in transient storage (\\u201cdata objects\\u201d)\\nthat differs from data stored in non-transient storage (\\u201ca file\\u201d) among the\\ndisclosures in Garland. The Examiner\\u2019s \\ufb01nding that \\u201cdata objects\\u201d are\\n\\nas\\n\\nequivalent to Garland\\u2019s collection of one or more data \\ufb01les containing data\\nelements\\u201d for purposes of the claimed invention improperly eliminates any\\ndifferentiation between the clai1nter111s \\u201cdata objects in memory\" and \\u201cfile\\u201d\\nas recited in claim 1. Claims are to be construed with an eye toward giving\\neffect to all terms in the claim. Eicon Inc. v. Straumaim C0., 441 F.3d 945,\\n950 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also Slumbo v. Eastman Outdoors, Inc, 508 F.3d\\n1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (denouncing claim constructions that render\\nphrases in claims superfluous).\\n\\nIn summary, the Examiner has not shown that Garland discloses a\\n\\nmethod meeting all of the limitations of claim 1. We therefore reverse theAppeal 2011-002877\\n\\nApplication 11/345,048\\n\\nExaminer\\u2019s rejection of claim 1 and dependent claims 2-5 and 7 as\\nanticipated by Garland.\\n\\nThe Examiner further \\ufb01nds that clai111s 8- 13, 17, 18, 20, 22-25, 28,\\nand 29 are anticipated by Garland. for the sa111e reasons as set forth with\\nrespect to clai111 1 above.

McConnell does not teach the\\nclaimed matchmaker which considers each work entry with respect to each\\nresource entry, as speci\\ufb01cally required by claim 20. McConnell compares a\\nsingle call (i.e. a work entry) from a queue to each agent (i.e. a resource\\nentry) in a queue group, but does not co111pare each call fro111 the queue to\\neach agent in the queue group. See McConnell 1111 [0085]-[0089]. See also\\nMcConnell 11 [0078]. We note that the Examiner does not rely upon Mullen\\n\\nor provide any other evidence to teach the limitation at issue.

Patent Owner ____  Appeal 2013-007871 Inter partes Reexamination Control No. 95/001,544 United States Patent 7,400,274 B2  Technology Center 3900 ____________   Before ALLEN R. MacDONALD, THU A. DANG, and STEPHEN C. SIU, Administrative Patent Judges.  SIU, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL\\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007871 Reexamination Control 95/001,544 Patent 7,400,274 B2  2   This proceeding arose from a third party request on behalf of CME Group, Inc., New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., and Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. for an inter partes reexamination of U. S. Patent 7,400,274 B2 (the \\u2019274 patent), entitled \\u201cSystem and Method for Data Feed Acceleration and Encryption,\\u201d assigned to Realtime Data LLC and issued to James J. Fallon, Paul F. Pickel, Stephen J. McErlain, and Carlton W. Melone (July 15, 2008).  Requester appeals the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt proposed rejections of claims 1-10 and 12.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7\\xa7 134 and 306.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE The \\u2019274 patent describes transmission of broadcast data over a communication channel using data compression and decompression (col. 6, ll. 4-7).  Claim 1 on appeal reads as follows: 1.  A method comprising:  recognizing a data field type of a data field in a packet; selecting an encoder associated with the recognized data field type; compressing the data in the data field with the selected encoder; broadcasting the compressed data to a plurality of clients, wherein the compressing achieves a compression ratio of over 10: 1; and utilizing a decompression state machine that comprises a plurality of decompression tables to decompress the compressed data on at least one of the plurality of clients.  (App. Br. 25, Claims Appendix.)  Requester proposes rejections of claims over the following prior art references: Willis    U.S. 4,745,559   May 17, 1988 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007871 Reexamination Control 95/001,544 Patent 7,400,274 B2  3  Carr    U.S. 5,293,379   Mar. 8, 1994 Zusman   U.S. 5,987,432   Nov. 16, 1999 Birdwell   U.S. 6,032,197   Feb. 29, 2000 Sebastian   U.S. 6,253,264 B1   Jun. 26, 2001  XML-Xpress White Paper, December 2000 (\\u201cXML\\u201d)  Danskin, J., \\u201cCompressing the X Graphics Protocol,\\u201d Jan. 1995 (\\u201cDanskin\\u201d)  Hartmut Liefke and Dan Suciu, \\u201cXMill, an Efficient Compressor for XML Data,\\u201d Oct. 1999 (\\u201cXMill\\u201d)  M.

Requester appeals the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt the following proposed rejections: Claim 12 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by XMill, Danskin, or RFC2507; Claim 12 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Birdwell and one of Carr or XML; Claims 1-5 and 8-10 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Birdwell and one of XMill or Danskin; Claims 5-7 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Birdwell, Willis, and one of XMill, Danskin, Sebastian, or RFC2507; Claims 1-8 and 10 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Zusman and one of XMill or Danskin; Claims 1-4, 8-10, and 12 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Sebastian and Birdwell; Claims 1-10 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over RFC2507 and Zusman. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007871 Reexamination Control 95/001,544 Patent 7,400,274 B2  4  Requester also argues that claims 1-30 are not entitled to priority to U.S. Patent Application 09/969,987, filed October 3, 2001, or to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60,237,571, filed October 3, 2000.    DISCUSSION XMill Reference The Examiner finds that XMill fails to disclose packet data (ACP 14).  In particular, the Examiner disagrees with Requester\\u2019s construction of the term \\u201cpacket\\u201d to include \\u201cany segregation of data\\u201d (ACP 16) because, according to the Examiner, Carr discloses data packets that \\u201cinclude at least static and dynamic field,\\u201d Birdwell discloses data packets \\u201cwith uncompressed/compressed headers,\\u201d and XML discloses \\u201ccompression at the \\u2018packet\\u2019 level\\u201d that differs from \\u201ccompression at a \\u2018file\\u2019 level\\u201d (ACP 17).  Based on each of the Carr, Birdwell, and XML references, the Examiner states that a data packet must \\u201cinclude more than a mere segregation of data\\u201d (ACP 17).  The Examiner relies on the Birdwell reference to support the position that a data packet must contain \\u201cuncompressed/compressed headers.\\u201d  As the Examiner points out, Birdwell discloses \\u201cfull-length data packets, which have uncompressed headers, and reduced-length data packets, which have compressed headers\\u201d (col. 2, ll. 15-17).  However, at best, Birdwell discloses the use of full-length data packets, which have compressed headers and reduced-length data packets, which have compressed headers.  The Examiner does not persuasively demonstrate that Birdwell also discloses that all data packets must include compressed or uncompressed headers and that \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007871 Reexamination Control 95/001,544 Patent 7,400,274 B2  5  one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that any segregation of data lacking an uncompressed or compressed header is not a data packet.  Similarly, the Examiner relies on the Carr reference to support the position that a data packet must contain \\u201cstatic and dynamic fields.\\u201d  As the Examiner points out, Carr discloses a system \\u201cthat employs data packets which include at least static and dynamic fields\\u201d (col. 3, ll. 31-33).  At best, Carr discloses a system that utilizes data packets with static or dynamic fields.  The Examiner does not persuasively demonstrate that Carr also discloses that all data packets must include static and/or dynamic fields and that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that any segregation of data lacking a static or dynamic field is not a data packet.  The Examiner relies on the XML reference to support the position that a data packet must be compressed in a manner that is \\u201cdistinguished from\\u201d compression of a \\u201cfile\\u201d (ACP 17).  As the Examiner points out, XML discloses a \\u201cdemo\\u201d that \\u201ccompresses at the file level\\u201d and a system in which \\u201ceach input packet is encoded as [quickly] as it is received\\u201d (p. 4).  At best, XML discloses a system that encodes packets as quickly as they are received.  The Examiner does not persuasively demonstrate that XML discloses that all data packets must include any specific feature.  While XML discloses a system that encodes packets as quickly as the packets are received, we disagree with the Examiner that the system quickly encoding packets constitutes a definition of a data packet as would have been understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.   Given that none of Birdwell, Carr, or XML discloses a specific definition of a data packet and none of the references disclose any specifically required feature of a data packet as would have been understood \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007871 Reexamination Control 95/001,544 Patent 7,400,274 B2  6  by one of ordinary skill in the art, we cannot agree with Examiner\\u2019s position a data packet must \\u201cinclude more than a mere segregation of data\\u201d (ACP 17). Also, as the Requester points out, the Specification of the \\u2019274 patent discloses that \\u201c[i]f there is internal structure to packets, such as a header . . ., additional global states could be added\\u201d (col. 10, ll. 39-53; 3PR App. Br. 7-8, citing Declaration under 37 C.F.R. 1.132 of Paul C. Clark, dated August 19, 2011 (\\u201cClark Declaration\\u201d), \\xb6 29).  In other words, the Specification does not disclose that a data packet must contain an internal structure.  Indeed, the Specification explicitly discloses that a packet may have an internal structure (i.e., \\u201cif\\u201d there is an internal structure), such as a header, and therefore implies that an internal structure is an optional feature of a data packet.  The Examiner does not persuasively rebut the Requester\\u2019s argument.  Therefore, we agree with Requester that a broad but reasonable construction of the term \\u201cdata packet\\u201d includes a segregation of data that does not require a specific internal structure.      XMill discloses compression and decompression of XML data (p. 2, l. 1) that is \\u201csemistructured data\\u201d (p. 2, l. 4) that may be grouped into \\u201ccontainers\\u201d (p. 2. \\u2013 \\u201cgrouping data items in containers\\u201d).  The Examiner does not adequately point out any substantial differences between the \\u201csemistructured data\\u201d in containers (i.e., segregation of data) and the \\u201cdata packet\\u201d as claimed.   The Examiner also states that XMill fails to disclose or suggest recognizing a data field type of a data field in a packet, as recited in claim 1.  However, XMill discloses different compressors that are used to compress different types of data, including \\u201cspecialized compressors if [users] have \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007871 Reexamination Control 95/001,544 Patent 7,400,274 B2  7  complex, application specific data types\\u201d (p. 2).1  Hence, XMill discloses processing a stream of data and applying a corresponding encoder based on the types of data in the data stream.  In order to process the data, one of ordinary skill in the art would have understood that the data would have been recognized.  Otherwise, the data would not be processed, not having been recognized as data to be processed in the first place.  Hence, the Examiner does not persuasively demonstrate a difference between XMill and the claim limitations of recognizing a data type of data and processing the data.   The Examiner does not provide additional findings with respect to claims 1-10 and 12 or with respect to any of Birdwell, Willis, or Zusman in combination with XMill. The Examiner erred in refusing to adopt the rejection of claim 12 as anticipated by XMill, claims 1-5 and 8-10 as obvious over XMill and Birdwell, claims 5-7 as obvious over XMill, Birdwell, and Willis, and claims 1-8 and 10 as obvious over XMill and Zusman. Reversal of the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt the proposed rejections of claims 1-10 and 12 over XMill, either alone or in combination with Birdwell, Willis and/or Zusman renders it unnecessary to reach the propriety of the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt proposed rejections of those claims on a different basis.  Cf. In re Gleave, 560 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  As                                            1 XMill also discloses, for example, \\u201c[c]omplex compressors . . . for a variety of specialized data types, e.g. images, sound, DNA sequences\\u201d (p. 8) and that \\u201cusers can write new . . . compressors and link them to XMill\\u201d which is \\u201cuseful when . . . data contains highly specialized types, like DNA sequences, for which special purpose compressors exists\\u201d (p. 9, 4th paragraph). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007871 Reexamination Control 95/001,544 Patent 7,400,274 B2  8  such, we need not reach the propriety of the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt the proposed rejections of those claims over Danskin, Sebastian, Carr, XML, or RFC2507. We also need not consider the Requester\\u2019s arguments pertaining to priority of the \\u2019274 patent.   DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s decision not to adopt the proposed rejections of claim 12 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by XMill; claims 1-5 and 8-10 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over XMill and Birdwell; claims 5-7 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over XMill, Birdwell, and Willis; and claims 1-8 and 10 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over XMill and Zusman is reversed. Pursuant to 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.77(a), the above-noted reversal constitutes a new ground of rejection.  Section 41.77(b) provides that \\u201c[a] new ground of rejection . . . shall not be considered final for judicial review.\\u201d  That section also provides that Patent Owner, WITHIN ONE MONTH FROM THE DATE OF THE DECISION, must exercise one of the following two options with respect to the new grounds of rejection to avoid termination of the appeal proceeding as to the rejected claims: (1) Reopen prosecution. The owner may file a response requesting reopening of prosecution before the examiner.  Such a response must be either an amendment of the claims so rejected or new evidence relating to the claims so rejected, or both.           (2) Request rehearing.  The owner may request that the proceeding be reheard under \\xa7 41.79 by the Board upon the same record.  The request for rehearing must \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007871 Reexamination Control 95/001,544 Patent 7,400,274 B2  9  address any new ground of rejection and state with particularity the points believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked in entering the new ground of rejection and also state all other grounds upon which rehearing is sought.  In accordance with 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.79(a)(1), the \\u201c[p]arties to the appeal may file a request for rehearing of the decision within one month of the date of: . . . [t]he original decision of the Board under \\xa7 41.77(a).\\u201d  A request for rehearing must be in compliance with 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.79(b).  Comments in opposition to the request and additional requests for rehearing must be in accordance with 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.79(c) & (d), respectively.  Under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.79(e), the times for requesting rehearing under paragraph (a) of this section, for requesting further rehearing under paragraph (d) of this section, and for submitting comments under paragraph (c) of this section may not be extended. An appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7\\xa7 141-144 and 315 and 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.983 for an inter partes reexamination proceeding \\u201ccommenced\\u201d on or after November 2, 2002 may not be taken \\u201cuntil all parties' rights to request rehearing have been exhausted, at which time the decision of the Board is final and appealable by any party to the appeal to the Board.\\u201d 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.81.

According to Appellant,\\n\\nthe \"uniform\" markings on the plurality of packages of the\\nclai111ed subject matter re\\ufb02ect non\\u2014inl1erent, inventive qualities,\\ni.e., the availability of a broad range of food packages/products\\nfrom which to choose. each package having a uniform calorie\\ncontent of 100 calories, thus de\\ufb01ning a dietary \"system\" which\\nis simply not available in the prior art, which may disclose a\\nrandom package of food, here and there, having a 100-calorie\\ncontent.\\n\\n(Id. at 3).\\n\\nAppellant then inconsistently argues our analysis of this allegedly-\\nignored claim recitation led to an incorrect determination that the claim I\\nmarkings do not render the claim patentable because they constitute printed\\nmatter having no functional relationship with its substrate (id. at 6-1 0).\\nAppellant urges that the clai111ed markings \"have the speci\\ufb01c function of\\ncoupling multiple packages for use in practicing the claimed dietary\\nsystem by allowing consumers to choose various foods across a broad\\nspectrum of food products\" (id. at 10-1 1).\\n\\nFor the reasons given in the Answer and the Decision, we maintain\\nour determination that the claimed markings do not render claim 1\\n\\npatentable (1) because they constitute printed matter having no functionalAppeal 2012-005531\\n\\nApplication 12/483,799\\n\\nrelationship to its substrate and (2) because it would l1ave been prima facie\\nobvious to provide the food display system of Rifkin with packages having\\nsuch markings (see, e.g., Dec. 4-6). Further, we emphasize that, contrary to\\nthe implications above. Appellant does not establish or even assert claim 1 is\\nlimited to \"a broad range of food packages/products\" (Req. 3) or \"various\\nfoods across a broad spectrum of food products\" (id. at 11; bolding\\nremoved).\\n\\nAppellant also argues that our Decision erroneously sustained the\\nExa1niner\\'s \\xa7 103 rejection of claims 7 and 12 (id. at 11-13).\\n\\nAppellant\\'s argument is not persuasive. ln View of Gelsinger, it would\\nhave been prima facie obvious to provide the modi\\ufb01ed Rifkin system with\\nremovably affixable labels as required by these claims for the reasons\\ndetailed in the Answer and the Decision (see, e. g., Dec. 7).\\n\\nFinally, Appellant argues that we inappropriately declined to consider\\nthe Evidence Appendices discussed in the Appeal Brief \"for failure to attach\\nthe Appendices to the Brief\\u2018 (Req. 6). Appellant asserts that \"the Honorable\\nBoard had knowledge of these cited Appendices [i.e.. because they were\\nallegedly attached to Appeal Briefs in related appeals involving different\\napplications] and should have considered them. along with Appellant\\'s\\narguments directed thereto\" (z\\'d.).\\n\\nAs fully explained in our Decision, we declined to consider the\\nEvidence Appendices discussed in the Appeal Briefbecause Appellant not\\nonly had failed to attach the Appendices to the Brief but also had failed to\\nstate where in the record such evidence was entered by the Examiner as\\nrequired by 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 4l.37(c)(l)(ix) (Dec. 7-8). lnterestingly, this latter\\n\\nfailure continues in the subject Request. For all we know. the Examiner hasAppeal 2012-005531\\nApplication 12/483,799\\n\\nnever entered and considered this evidence during prosecution of the subject\\napplication. Under these circumstances, we properly declined to consider\\nthe Evidence Appendices regardless of whether such evidence had been\\n\\npreviously considered in related appeals involving different applications.\\n\\nAppellant\\'s Request for Rehearing is DENIED with respect to making\\n\\nany changes in our Decision.\\nDENIED\\n\\nbar'},\n",

We AFFIRM. I. BACKGROUND  A request for inter partes reexamination under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7\\xa7 311-318 and 37 C.F.R. \\xa7\\xa7 1.902-1.997 for the \\u2018347 Patent was filed January 29, 2009 by Requester (Request for Inter Partes Reexamination).  An oral hearing was held on October 2, 2013.  A transcript of the oral hearing will be entered into the record in due course. The \\u2019347 Patent is directed to a titanium compressor wheel having both aerodynamic efficiency and manufacturability.  \\u2019347 Patent, col. 4, ll. 8-21.  More particularly, the \\u2019347 Patent is directed to a simplified blade design, which is aerodynamically comparable, and yet can be produced in an investment casting process using a wax pattern easily producible at low cost from an automated and pullable die.  Id. at col. 4, ll. 46-53.  Claims 1-7 are pending and stand rejected.  Right of Appeal Notice 3-10, mailed August 27, 2012 (hereinafter \\u201cRAN\\u201d); PO App. Br. 5.  The claims are all original claims which have not been amended during reexamination.  Claim 1, 5 and 7 are the independent claims.  Claim 1 is representative and reads as follows:                                            2 See Patent Owner Appeal Brief 3, filed November 26, 2012 (hereinafter \\u201cPO App. Br.\\u201d). 3 The \\u2019347 Patent issued December 16, 2003, to David Decker et al. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  3  1. A titanium centrifugal compressor wheel formed by an investment casting process, and including: a hub defining an axis of rotation, and a plurality of backswept aerodynamic blades carried on the surface of said hub and defining air passages between adjacent blades,  wherein each of said air passages is defined by from one to three solid die inserts which can be inserted between and pulled from between said blades without deformation of said dies or blades. PO App. Br. 35, Claim App\\u2019x. The claims stand rejected as follows; 1. Claims 1, 3-5 and 7 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as anticipated by Hofmeister (RAN 3-4);4 2. Claims 1 and 3-7 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Hofmeister in view of Solar (RAN 5-6);5 3. Claim 2 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable based on the rejections to claim 1 above further in view of Hyll (RAN 6-7 and 8-9);6  4. Claims 3 and 7 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable based on the rejections to claim 1 above further in view of Fabiani (RAN 7-8 and 9-10).7                                            4 EP 0 728 545 A2, published August 28, 1996, and naming Heinz Hofmeister et al. as inventors (hereinafter \\u201cHofmeister\\u201d).  All reference to Hofmeister is to the English language translation of record. 5 Alvin N. Hammer, Evaluation of Cast Titanium Alloy Compressor Components, Volume 1, published by U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service on behalf of Solar Turbines International (November 1981) (hereinafter \\u201cSolar\\u201d). 6 US 4,706,928, issued November 17, 1987, to John Hyll. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  4   1.  ANTICIPATION BY HOFMEISTER  Claims 1, 3-5 and 7 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as anticipated by Hofmeister.   Independent claim 1 recites, inter alia, a titanium centrifugal compressor wheel with air passages between blades designed such that \\u201cfrom one to three solid die inserts . . .  can be inserted between and pulled from between said blades without deformation of said dies or blades.\\u201d  Independent claims 5 and 7 recite, inter alia, a titanium centrifugal compressor wheel (a) having a \\u201cleading edge\\u201d which is \\u201csubstantially a straight edge\\u201d and (b) having blades designed such that one or more solid die inserts \\u201ccan be inserted between adjacent blades and retracted along a radial or curved path.\\u201d  Dependent claim 3 recites that \\u201cthe number of die inserts necessary to define the air passage between said blades is two.\\u201d  PO App. Br. 35-36, Claim App\\u2019x.  The Requester argued, and the Examiner agreed, that Hofmeister describes a titanium centrifugal compressor wheel which meets all the limitations of the independent claims.  RAN 3-4.  The Examiner determined that the claims provide no limitation with respect to the term \\u201cpulled\\u201d or the phrase \\u201calong a radial or curved path\\u201d so as to preclude the dies being pulled in an \\u2018\\u201cS\\u2019 curve,\\u201d as described by Hofmeister.  RAN 35.  Indeed, the lead cams 10 of Figure 2 of Hofmeister define the movement of the mold parts 5 away from the molded structure in an \\u201cS-shaped\\u201d curve including an                                                                                                                               7 DE 1806757, published May 21, 1970, and naming Nicola Fabiani as the sole inventor.  All reference to Fabiani is to the English language translation of record. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  5  inflection point 44.  Hofmeister, col. 10, ll. 26-28 and 35-39.  Figure 2 of Hofmeister is reproduced below.  Figure 2 depicts a top view of the transport mechanism 30 of a compressor blade wheel mold with a partially cutaway view of the underlying tension plate 7.  The blade interspace mold segments 5 are illustrated by way of example in the starting position A and in the demolding position B.  Hofmeister, col. 5, ll. 2-8, col. 6, l. 56 to col. 7, l. 3, and col. 9, ll. 49-52. With respect to claims 5 and 7, the Requester argued, and the Examiner agreed, that Hofmeister teaches a compressor blade wheel with a blade having a leading edge that is substantially a straight edge because \\u201c[t]he term substantially allows for some degree of curvature to the leading edge.\\u201d  RAN 3 and 19.   Patent Owner contends that a correct interpretation of the claims, based on statements in the \\u2019347 Patent, require that the dies be pulled along a \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  6  \\u201cstraight radial path\\u201d or along a \\u201csimple or compound curve.\\u201d  PO App. Br. 14.    Patent Owner further contends that Hofmeister fails to teach a blade with a leading edge that is \\u201csubstantially a straight edge.\\u201d  PO App. Br. 21 and 25-26.  Patent Owner contends that the term \\u201csubstantially a straight edge\\u201d requires (a) an \\u201cabsence of dips or humps\\u201d and (b) a curvature that \\u201cdoes not interfere with pullability of die inserts.\\u201d  Id. With respect to claim 3, Patent Owner further argues that Hofmeister fails to teach two die inserts defining an air passage between blades.  PO App. Br. 26. Accordingly, much of our discussion for this rejection focuses on claim interpretation. During reexamination, \\u201cclaims . . . are to be given their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification, and . . . claim language should be read in light of the specification as it would be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art.\\u201d  In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr., 367 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting In re Bond, 910 F.2d 831, 833 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).   \\u201c[W]e look to the specification to see if it provides a definition for claim terms, but otherwise apply a broad interpretation.\\u201d  In re ICON Health and Fitness, Inc., 496 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \\u201c[L]imitations are not to be read into the claims from the specification.\\u201d  In re Van Geuns, 988 F.2d 1181, 1184 (Fed. Cir. 1993). \\u2018\\u201c[R]eading a claim in the light of the specification,\\u2019 to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from \\u2018reading limitations of the specification into a \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  7  claim,\\u2019 to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed limitations which have no express basis in the claim.\\u201d  In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404 (CCPA 1969).   When the Specification expresses a clear disavowal or disclaimer of coverage extended by a claim, the claim is read as having such limited scope as expressly stated by the Specification.  See In re Bigio, 381 F.3d 1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2004); In re Am. Acad. of Science Tech Ctr., 367 F.3d at 1369.  However, \\u201c[m]ere criticism of a particular embodiment encompassed in the plain meaning of a claim term is not sufficient to rise to the level of clear disavowal.\\u201d  Thorner v. Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing Epistar Corp. v. Int\\u2019l Trade Comm\\u2019n, 566 F.3d 1321, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). Therefore, we look to the specification for a definition of claim terms, but otherwise apply a broad interpretation.   \\u201cpulled\\u201d and \\u201cretracted along a radial or curved path\\u201d The \\u2019347 Patent does not define the term \\u201cpulled\\u201d but provides a definition for the term \\u201cpullable,\\u201d namely \\u201ccan be withdrawn radially or along a curvature.\\u201d  \\u2019347 Patent, col. 6, ll. 54-57.  In light of this definition, we find it reasonable to interpret the term \\u201cpulled\\u201d in claim 1 to be consistent with the express language of claims 5 and 7, namely \\u201cretracted along a radial or curved path.\\u201d  However, we disagree with Patent Owner that the term \\u201ccurvature\\u201d or the phrase \\u201calong a . . . curved path\\u201d should be more narrowly interpreted to preclude an \\u201cS-shaped\\u201d curve as taught by \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  8  Hofmeister, because, as further explained infra, an \\u201cS-shaped\\u201d pattern has \\u201ca curvature\\u201d and an \\u201cS-shaped\\u201d path is \\u201ca curved path.\\u201d The \\u2018347 Patent does not expressly define \\u201ccurvature.\\u201d  Accordingly, we turn to the plain meaning of the term.  The term \\u201ccurvature\\u201d means \\u201cthe state of being curved\\u201d and the term \\u201ccurve\\u201d means \\u201cdeviation from a straight line or plane surface without sharp breaks or angularity.\\u201d8  Thus, the \\u201cS-shaped\\u201d or \\u201cinflected\\u201d path, by which the die inserts of Hofmeister are removed, falls within the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claims, inasmuch as such paths constitute a smooth curved shape without sharp angles or breaks. The \\u2019347 Patent states that the die inserts \\u201cmust be extractable along a straight line or simple curve\\u201d in the context of \\u201caspects that were taken into consideration\\u201d in making a die insert retractable.  \\u2019347 Patent, col. 6, l. 57-col. 7, l. 3 and col. 7, ll. 49-57.  While some or all of these considerations may have been considered in designing the compressor wheel exemplified in the figures of the \\u2019347 Patent, claim 1 only requires that dies are \\u201cpulled\\u201d which is expressly defined as radially or along a curvature.  No other of these listed \\u201cconsiderations\\u201d of the compressor wheel are recited in claim 1 to warrant narrowing the scope of the claims to the particularly designed compressor wheel of the \\u2019347 Patent.9  For example, the \\u2019347 Patent also describes wide \\u201cblade spacing\\u201d and limited \\u201crake and/or backsweep\\u201d so as to                                            8 See Merriam Webster Online Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/curvature and http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/curve, accessed October 28, 2013. 9 Claim 5 and claim 7 further recite another of these considerations, namely that the leading edge is substantially straight, which we discuss in detail infra. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  9  not \\u201cimpede extraction of the inserts along a straight line or a simple curve.\\u201d  See \\u2019347 Patent, col. 6, ll. 60-62 and col. 8, ll. 27-30.  We decline to read into the claims any blade spacing, rake or backsweep, and, accordingly, we decline to read into the claims any particular curvature by which the die inserts must be removed, as these features are not recited in the claims.  Patent Owner has directed us to no persuasive rationale as to why these considerations should be read into the claims.   While the \\u2019347 Patent provides a particular embodiment via Figures 7-10 in which the dies are pulled \\u201cradially\\u201d or \\u201calong some simple or compound curve\\u201d (col. 6, ll. 18-19; col. 9, ll. 1-7), neither the language of the claims nor the definition of \\u201cpullable\\u201d discussed above limit the claimed retraction path to a straight radial path, a single curved path, or a compound curved path as argued by Patent Owner.  The mere presence of exemplary paths is not a disavowal or disclaimer as to any other shape that may be defined as \\u201ca curvature\\u201d or \\u201ca curved path.\\u201d  We note that the U.S. District Court for the District of North Carolina, Asheville Division, in the case styled BorgWarner Inc. v. Honeywell Int\\u2019l, Inc., Civil Case No. 1:07cv184, interpreted the term \\u201cpulled\\u201d in the \\u2019347 Patent as \\u201cwithdrawn radially or along a curvature to render the pattern easily removable from the die.\\u201d  PO App. Br., Related Proceedings App\\u2019x, Exhibit 2 at 51.  The District Court further defined \\u201ceasily removable\\u201d to mean \\u201cwithdrawn a sufficient distance from the closed position so as to clear the periphery of the wax pattern so that the pattern may be easily removed from the die.\\u201d  Id. at 47.  Our interpretation is consistent with the District Court interpretation.  Specifically, there is insufficient evidence to suggest \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  10  the S-shaped path taught by Hofmeister does not reflect a path by which the dies are easily removed from the wax pattern.  In fact, Hofmeister states that \\u201cthe horizontal guiding of the mold segments on the cam plate facilitates precise withdrawal of the mold segments from the three-dimensionally shaped areas between the individual blades, thereby avoiding damage to the three-dimensionally curved blade contour.\\u201d  Hofmeister, col. 4, ll. 3-9.  Hofmeister teaches \\u201ca simple and exact demolding process for the blade interspaces\\u201d that \\u201callows for the casting or injection process to be automated.\\u201d  Id. at col. 11, ll. 3-8.  Accordingly, we find that Hofmeister teaches easy removal of the die inserts for the withdrawal of the wax pattern from the mold. Patent Owner places much emphasis on the statement in Hofmeister that its backsweep is such that \\u201cit is no longer possible to merely pull out the blade interspace segments 5.\\u201d  Hofmeister, col. 5, ll. 35-48.  However, Hofmeister describes overcoming this problem using the mold described therein having an S-shaped pathway to remove the die inserts.  Id. at col. 48-51 (\\u201cAt this point the invention employs the mold illustrated in Figures 1-3 for manufacturing the described centrifugal compressor impeller 20.\\u201d).  Accordingly, Patent Owner\\u2019s contentions in this regard are not persuasive. Patent Owner further contends that the District Court, in a decision on Summary Judgment, further defined the term \\u201cpulled\\u201d as being along a \\u201csimple or compound curve\\u201d by distinguishing the claims from the \\u201czig zag withdrawal\\u201d of inserts in a piece of prior art the District Court refers to as \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  11  \\u201cHolset Wheel.\\u201d10  See PO App. Br. 23-24 and Related Proceedings App\\u2019x, Exhibit 3 at 28-29.  In that decision, the Court stated that it \\u201cconstrued this term [\\u201cpulled\\u201d] to mean that the inserts were \\u2018withdrawn radially or along a curvature,\\u2019 not a series of curvatures, as now contended by Honeywell.\\u201d  Id.   For the reasons discussed above, we consider an \\u201cS-shaped curve\\u201d to be \\u201ca curvature\\u201d in the same manner that one would describe a sine or cosine as a curve despite its inflection points.   Moreover, we need not defer to the District Court\\u2019s interpretation, as the District Court uses a different standard in interpreting claims.  See In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr., 367 F.3d at 1369 (\\u201c[I]t is error for the Board to \\u2018appl[y] the mode of claim interpretation that is used by courts in litigation, when interpreting the claims of issued patents in connection with determination of infringement and validity.\\u201d\\u2019).  We do not consider the District Court\\u2019s interpretation of \\u201ca curvature\\u201d as \\u201cnot a series of curvatures\\u201d to be the broadest reasonable interpretation read in light of the specification as it would be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art.  A general rule of claim interpretation is that the term \\u201ca\\u201d means \\u201cone or more.\\u201d  Baldwin Graphic Systems, Inc. v. Siebert, 512 F.3d 1338, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (\\u201cThat \\u2018a\\u2019 or \\u2018an\\u2019 can mean \\u2018one or more\\u2019 is best described as a rule, rather                                            10 The \\u201cHolset Wheel\\u201d reference is not before us in this proceeding, and Patent Owner has provided no sufficient evidence that the prior art before us describes the same \\u201czig zag withdrawal\\u201d pattern disclosed in the reference considered by the District Court.  We understand a zigzag shape to be distinguishable from an \\u201cS-shaped\\u201d curve, due to a zigzag shape having abrupt or angled turns.  See Merriam Webster Online Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zigzag, accessed October 28, 2013 (\\u201cone of a series of short sharp turns, angles, or alterations in a course\\u201d). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  12  than merely as a presumption or even a convention. The exceptions to this rule are extremely limited: a patentee must \\u2018evince[ ] a clear intent\\u2019 to limit \\u2018a\\u2019 or \\u2018an\\u2019 to \\u2018one.\\u2019\\u201d) (quoting KCJ Corp. v. Kinetic Concepts, Inc., 223 F.3d 1351, 1356 (Fed.Cir.2000)).  The \\u2019347 Patent expresses no clear intent to limit the curvature to a simple curve or a compound curve.  Mere exemplary embodiments of a straight curve or a compound curve cannot be reasonably attributed to an intent to disclaim all other curved paths that provide for easy removal of a die insert.  From Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (\\u201c[A]lthough the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention, we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments.\\u201d).  \\u201csubstantially straight edge\\u201d  The \\u2019347 Patent does not define the phrase \\u201csubstantially straight\\u201d and does not limit the scope of the phrase to any particular degree of straightness.  However, the \\u2019347 Patent states that  the leading edge 17 of the blades are essentially straight, having no dips or humps which would impede radial extraction of die inserts. That is, there may be a slight rounding up 18 (i.e., continuation of the blade along the blade pitch) where the blade joins the hub, but this curvature does not interfere with pullability of die inserts.  \\u2019347 Patent, col. 8, ll. 1-6.  The \\u2019347 Patent also references Figure 4 as showing \\u201ca substantially straight shoulder of the blade from neck 18 to tip 19.\\u201d \\u2019347 Patent, col. 8, ll. 34-37.

The word \\u201csubstantially\\u201d has been construed many times by our reviewing court.  It can be a term of approximation or a term of magnitude with meaning varying from \\u201csignificantly\\u201d or \\u201cconsiderably\\u201d to \\u201clargely\\u201d or \\u201cessentially.\\u201d  See Deering Precision Instruments L.L.C. v. Vector Distribution Sys. Inc., 347 F.3d 1314, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  While the modifier \\u201csubstantially\\u201d certainly does broaden the term \\u201cstraight\\u201d to some degree, it \\u201ccannot be allowed to negate the meaning of the word it modifies.\\u201d  See In re Hauserman, Inc., 892 F.2d 1049, 15 USPQ2d 1157, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (unpublished)(quoting Arvin Industries, Inc. v. Berns Air King Corp., 525 F.2d 182, 185 (7th Cir. 1975) and citing Borg-Warner Corp. v. Paragon Gear Works, Inc., 355 F.2d 400, 404 (1st Cir. 1965)). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  14   We determine that the phrase \\u201csubstantially straight\\u201d allows for some curvature to the leading edge of the blade, but must be sufficiently straight such that any curvature to the leading edge does not interfere with pullability of die inserts.  As discussed above, we find the blades of Hofmeister provide that the die inserts used therein are \\u201cpullable.\\u201d  Patent Owner has presented no meaningful evidence that any curvature of the leading edge of the blade of Hofmeister particularly impedes the pullability of the die inserts, and such a finding would be contrary to teachings of the S-shaped path by which Hofmeister\\u2019s die inserts can be pulled.   Based on our review of Figure 4 of Hofmeister, we also find that the leading edge of the blade of Hofmeister is substantially straight, with a curvature formed where the blade meets the hub.  Figure 4 of Hofmeister is reproduced below.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  15  Figure 4 of Hofmeister depicts a top view of a centrifugal compressor impeller.  Hofmeister, col. 5, ll. 13-17.  Figure 4 has been annotated to add a dotted line illustrating a substantially straight leading edge.  Hofmeister states that \\u201cangle 24\\u201d is \\u201cbetween the leading edge 26 and the trailing edge 25 of the full blade 22.\\u201d  Hofmeister, col. 5, ll. 39-41.  Accordingly, Figure 4 provides a straight line defining the leading edge 26 as a portion of angle 24.  Figure 4 has been annotated with a dotted line on another blade, similar to the line defining the leading edge portion of angle 24, to show where the blade appears to be substantially straight with curvature occurring closer to the hub.    Accordingly, we find that Hofmeister\\u2019s blade has a leading edge meeting the \\u201csubstantially straight\\u201d requirement of claims 5 and 7.    Claim 3  With respect to claim 3, we disagree with Patent Owner that Hofmeister fails to teach two die inserts defining an air passage between blades.  See PO App. Br. 26.  The Examiner has found that Hofmeister \\u201cteaches two solid die inserts 15 and 16, which are inserted between adjacent full blades 22\\u201d such that \\u201cthe interface between inserts 15 and 16 form the splitter blade 21.\\u201d  RAN 25.   We agree with the Examiner that the two die inserts recited in claim 3 do not preclude the use of two such die inserts to characterize the formation of a splitter blade, similar to the splitter blades 15 described in the \\u2019347 Patent.  We find it of no moment that Hofmeister describes disadvantages of \\u201cmolds composed of multiple parts or individual segments,\\u201d since \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-007701 Reexamination Control 95/000,431 Patent 6,663,347 B2  16  Hofmeister expressly discloses a mold comprised of multiple die inserts 15 and 16.   Patent Owner does not separately argue the patentability of claim 4.  Thus, claim 4 falls with claim 1 from which it depends.  For the reasons discussed above, we find that Hofmeister anticipates claims 1, 3-5 and 7 of the \\u2019347 Patent.  2. OBVIOUSNESS BASED ON HOFMEISTER AND SOLAR  Claims 1, 3-5 and 7 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Hofmeister in view of Solar.

DECISION ON APPEAL  Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from a final rejection of claims 7-9, 11-14, and 17-27. We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b). We affirm.    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013527 Application 11/293,525   2STATEMENT OF THE CASE Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention is directed to electronic device and methods including button controls (Spec. \\xb6 [002]). Independent claim 13, reproduced below, is representative of the subject matter on appeal. 13. An electronic device comprising: a plurality of button systems, each of the button systems including: an image sheet including first and second source images;  a screen superimposed on the image sheet such that the image sheet is displayed to a user through the screen, wherein the screen includes a lenticular lens screen having at least one prism adapted to convert the first and second source images as displayed to the user into first and second displayed images, the first and second displayed images being different from the first and second source images; and  wherein the image sheet and the screen are relatively movable between a first position, wherein the button system displays the first source image to the user independent of viewing angle, and a second position, wherein the button system displays the second source image to the user independent of viewing angle; and  an actuator operable to relatively move at least one of the image sheet with respect to the screen and the screen with respect to the image sheet for each of the plurality of button systems simultaneously between the first position and the second position; and a controller operative to control the actuator.     \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013527 Application 11/293,525   3REFERENCES and REJECTIONS The Examiner rejected claims 7-9, 12-14, 18-22, 24, and 25 under U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) based upon the teachings of Bar-Yona (U.S. 6,226,906 B1 hereinafter \\u201cBar-Yona \\u2018906\\u201d) and Bar-Yona (U.S. 6,805,506 B2 hereinafter \\u201cBar-Yona \\u2018506\\u201d). The Examiner rejected claims 11, 17, 23, 26, and 27 under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 103(a) based upon the teachings of Bar-Yona \\u2018906, Bar-Yona \\u2018506, and Kasahara (U.S. 5,151,696).  ANALYSIS  Appellants contend Bar-Yona \\u2018906 and Bar-Yona \\u2018506 do not teach or suggest the limitation of an actuator operable to relatively move at least one of an image sheet for each of a plurality of button systems simultaneously between first and second positions (Br. 4-5).  The Examiner rebuts, in detail, Appellants\\u2019 contentions (see Ans. 24-30). We adopt the Examiner\\u2019s findings and reasoning set forth in the Answer. We highlight and address specific findings and arguments below.  Particularly, the Examiner has provided reasonable arguments regarding the combination of the Bar-Yona references. We agree that although Bar-Yona \\u2018906 does not explicitly disclose a button system as claimed, Bar Yona \\u2018506 discloses such a system (Ans. 9, 26-27).   We are further mindful a skilled artisan would \\u201cbe able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle\\u201d since the skilled artisan is \\u201ca person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton.\\u201d KSR Int\\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 420 (2007). Here, Appellants have not demonstrated the Examiner\\u2019s proffered combination would have been \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013527 Application 11/293,525   4\\u201cuniquely challenging or difficult for one of ordinary skill in the art.\\u201d See Leapfrog Enters., Inc. v. Fisher-Price, Inc., 485 F.3d 1157, 1162 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing KSR, 550 U.S. at 418). Appellants have not filed a Reply Brief rebutting the Examiner\\u2019s assertions.  Appellants provide no substantive arguments with respect to the combination of Bar-Yona \\u2018906, Bar-Yona \\u2018506, and Kasahara (Br. 6). We are therefore not persuaded of error regarding the Examiner\\u2019s proffered reasoning and motivation to combine the references and sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejections of claims 7-9, 11-14, and 17-27 under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 103 (a).  DECISION  The Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting claims 7-9, 11-14, and 17-27 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103 is affirmed.

GARRIS, Administrative Patent Judge.  HOUSEL, Administrative Patent Judge, concurring.  DECISION ON APPEAL  Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134, Appellant appeals from the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 1-19.  We have jurisdiction over the appeal under           35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We REVERSE.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-006319 Application 12/236,801   2CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER The claims are directed to a filter media that inhibits formation of a static electric charge in a fluid passing through the filter media.  Claims 1, 11, 17, and 18 are the independent claims on appeal.  Claims 1, 11, and 12 are illustrative of the subject matter on appeal and recite (italics added to emphasize argued limitations): 1. A filter media for filtering a prescribed liquid flowing therethrough comprising: a filtration layer having a first surface and a second surface opposite the first surface and comprising a non-conductive fibrous material having a plurality of fibers, the fibrous material having a metal layer deposited on at least a portion of the fibers through at least a portion of the thickness of the filtration layer, the filtration layer inhibiting formation of a static charge in the prescribed liquid when the prescribed liquid passes through the media.    11. A method of making a filter media for filtering a prescribed fluid comprising: providing a filtration layer having a first surface and a second surface opposite the first surface, the filtration layer comprising a non-conductive fibrous material having a plurality of fibers;  selecting a metal having a position in the triboelectric series closer to the prescribed fluid than the position of the fibrous material relative to the prescribed fluid; and  depositing the metal to form a metal layer on at least a portion of the fibers of the fibrous material through at least a portion of the thickness of the filtration layer.    12. The method according to claim 11, wherein depositing the metal comprises vacuum depositing the metal onto the fibers of the fibrous material.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-006319 Application 12/236,801   3 REJECTIONS 1) Claims 1 and 17-19 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as anticipated by Breusch (US 2004/0245169 A1, pub. Dec. 9, 2004). 2) Claims 2-11 and 13-16 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Breusch. 3) Claim 12 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Breusch in view of Hobson (US 5,527,569 issued Jun. 18, 1996).  ANALYSIS The rejection of claims 1 and 17-19 as anticipated by Breusch and the rejection of claims 2-11 and 13-16 as unpatentable over Breusch Claims 1 and 11, above, include a metal layer deposited on at least a portion of the fibers.   The Examiner argues that the metal and plastic \\u201cweave of fibers\\u201d disclosed in Breusch is included within the definition of deposit: \\u201c[t]he act of putting or placing something somewhere.\\u201d  (Ans. 11).  That is, in Breusch, \\u201c[t]he fibers are deposited on each other in the location where they overlap, meaning the fibers are put or placed on top of each other.\\u201d  (Id.). Appellant argues that overlapping fibers are not the same as a layer deposited on a fiber.  \\u201cThe overlapping fiber is just that, a fiber that overlaps.  It is not a \\u2018layer\\u2019 that is deposited on a fiber.\\u201d  (App. Br. 13).   We agree with Appellant that the meaning of deposit as used in the claims would not include the \\u201cweave of fibers\\u201d disclosed in Breusch.  The Specification discloses that the metal layer is to be provided by coating or \\u201cmetalizing\\u201d the fibers rather than weaving in metallic threads.  \\u201cThe fibers may be metalized by any suitable method including, for example, vacuum \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-006319 Application 12/236,801   4depositing a metal onto the fibers.  The metallization process, such as by vacuum deposition, may involve the infusion of metal particles onto the fibers.\\u201d  (Spec. 5-6). Based on the foregoing, we determine that the broadest reasonable meaning of the claim term \\u201cdeposit\\u201d consistent with the Specification is the coating or metallization of at least part of the fibers with a layer of metal, and does not include the \\u201cweave\\u201d taught by Breusch.  It is well settled that during examination, \\u201cclaims . . . are to be given their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification, and . . . claim language should be read in light of the specification as it would be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art.\\u201d  In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr., 367 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2004).   Accordingly, we reverse the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 1-11 and 13-19.    The rejection of claim 12 as unpatentable over Breusch in view of Hobson. Claim 12 includes the method of making a filter media of claim 11, but also includes vacuum depositing the metal onto the fibers of the fibrous material.   The Examiner concludes \\u201c[i]t would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the Breusch reference with the Hobson reference by using vacuum depositing to coat the fiber, since the Breusch reference discloses the use of a coated fiber and the Hobson reference discloses a method to make the fiber[,] the combination would yield the expected result of a vacuum deposited metal coated fiber.\\u201d  (Ans. 9). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-006319 Application 12/236,801   5Appellant argues that \\u201cthe Examiner has not articulated a reason why a person skilled in the art would modify Breusch to arrive at the claimed method. . . . Breusch does not even disclose or suggest depositing a metal layer on non-conductive fibers.  Lacking is any reason for the skilled person to look to Hobson.\\u201d  (App. Br. 22). Appellant is correct.  Breusch discloses the use of a \\u201czinc-coated iron material\\u201d as a conductive weft thread in the filter material (Breusch 0016), but does not disclose coating the non-conductive fibers with metal.  Thus, it would not be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to combine Breusch and Hobson so as to vacuum deposit a metal onto the non-conductive fibers of Breusch.  Accordingly, we reverse the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 12.   Conclusion The decision of the Examiner rejecting claims 1-19 is reversed.  REVERSED  cam    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-006319 Application 12/236,801   1HOUSEL, Administrative Patent Judge, concurring  Although I concur with the majority that the Examiner has not shown that Breusch anticipates or renders obvious the claimed invention, even when taken with Hobson, I write separately to raise the following matter which neither the Examiner nor the majority address.  Specifically, I find Hobson, column 1, lines 52-58 (fifth paragraph of Section 2. Description of Prior References) describes one prior art approach for controlling static electrical charges was to apply a coating of metals to the outside surface of fibers used in producing organic polymeric textile materials.  While this paragraph does not itself state that these materials are used for a filtration media, I find the context of this paragraph indicates this material is a filtration media.  In Section 1, I find Hobson teaches the field of the invention disclosed relates to antistatic, electrically conductive filtration material.  Hobson, 1:5-7.  Further, I find Hobson teaches the dangers in various industries due to uncontrolled electrostatic discharge.  Hobson, 1:10-19.  I find Hobson also teaches organic polymeric textile materials can be the source of static discharges, and that these materials can provide good filtration efficiency.  Hobson, 1:20-31.  Moreover, I find Hobson teaches to control static electrical charges found in these textile materials include providing antistatic surface finishes to the material, introducing at least partially conductive fibers into the material, and electrically grounding the material.  Hobson, 1:32-51.  I find, following the disclosure of applying a metal coating to the fibers used to prepare the textile material, Hobson teaches incorporating conductive fibers into a matrix of nonwoven filtration media.  Hobson, 1:60-65.  Finally, I find Hobson\\u2019s application of a metal coating onto the fibers \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-006319 Application 12/236,801   2used to prepare the textile filtration media is inherently equivalent to depositing a metal layer on the fibers through at least a portion of the filtration layer.  Accordingly, I find Hobson reads on, and therefore anticipates, the filter media of claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b).  Alternatively, should the context of Hobson\\u2019s disclosure of the metal coated fibers of the textile material not be found to support that the material is a filtration media, such context at least supports a conclusion that the use of this textile material as a filtration media would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a). \\x0c'},\n",

DIXON, ST. JOHN COURTENAY III, and CARLA M. KRIVAK, Administrative Patent Judges.  COURTENAY, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON REQUEST FOR REHEARING   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004594 Application 11/583,718   2 Appellants filed a Request for Rehearing under 37 C.F.R.  \\xa7 41.52(a)(1) for reconsideration of our Decision of July 26, 2013.  Our Decision affirmed the Examiner\\u2019s rejection Rl of claim 38 under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 102 and rejection R2 of claims 1-6, 8, 10, 14, and 15 under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 103.   We have reconsidered our Decision, in light of Appellants\\' arguments in the Request, and we are not persuaded that we misapprehended or overlooked any points in rendering our Decision.  We decline to change our prior Decision for the reasons discussed infra.  We address Appellants\\' arguments seriatim:   R1. CLAIM 38 UNDER \\xa7102  Regarding the claim 38 limitation [d] \"wherein the mold compound holds the thermally conducting body in the opening,\" the Examiner finds: Hosoyamada clearly shows in Fig. 6, a mold compound 6 holds a thermal conducting body 16 in the opening of the substrate 10. The molding compound 6 is adhered to multiple sides of the thermal conducting body 16 in the opening of the substrate 10, thus the thermal conducting body is considered being held by the molding compound. Although the thermal conducting body is also in contact with the printed circuit board 10, the claim language does not indicate that the thermal conducting body is being held in place exclusively by the molding compound. (Ans. 7-8).   Appellants contend the Examiner fails to make a prima facie case of anticipation.  In particular, Appellants contend the Examiner\\'s findings are merely conclusory allegations because \\u201cthe Examiner does not cite any portion of Hosoyamada as stating that mold resin 6, by simply contacting \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004594 Application 11/583,718   3thermally conducting body 16, holds [the] thermally conducting body in place.\\u201d (Request 4).    Appellants\\' contentions are not persuasive.  The Examiner cited Hosoyamada\\'s Figure 6 as disclosing \"the mold compound holds the thermally conducting body in the opening.\"  (Ans. 7-8; Hosoyamada Fig. 6).  Hosoyamada\\'s Figure 6 discloses the molding compound 6 and thermally conducting body 16 adhere together when inverted and therefore expressly supports the Examiner\\'s finding that molding compound 6 holds the thermally conducting body 16.  Furthermore, the Examiner\\'s technical reasoning supports the finding of inherency that the \"mold compound holds the thermally conducting body\" in a manner which necessarily flows from the teachings of the applied prior art.1  (Ans. 7-8).  Specifically, we find the Examiner\\'s reasoning \"[t]he molding compound 6 is adhered to multiple sides of the thermal conducting body 16 in the opening of the substrate 10,\" reasonably supports the finding Hosoyamada\\'s molding compound necessarily (inherently) holds the thermal conducting body 16, because the molding compound is attached to and therefore holds multiple surfaces of the thermal conducting body 16.  (Ans. 7-8; Hosoyamada Fig. 6).2                                              1 \"In relying upon the theory of inherency, the examiner must provide a basis in fact and/or technical reasoning to reasonably support the determination that the allegedly inherent characteristic necessarily flows from the teachings of the applied prior art.\" Ex parte Levy, 17 USPQ2d 1461, 1464 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990) (emphasis in original). 2 Moreover, the molding compound 6 and thermally conducting body 16 adhere together when inverted, and therefore molding compound 6 is attached to and holds thermally conducting body 16.  (See Hosoyamada Fig. 6). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004594 Application 11/583,718   4 Moreover, the Examiner\\'s technical reasoning is consistent with Appellants\\' cited support (App. Br. 8; Figs. 5, 6, 7A, 7B, 8, 10, 12E, 12F, 13F, 13G, 15D, and 15E, element 108) for limitation [d] which show the molding compound 108 contacting the thermally conducting body 524.  (Appellants\\u2019 Fig. 5).  Appellants\\' cited text sections of the Specification (Spec. \\xb6[0059], \\xb6[0082], \\xb6[0092]) do not describe \"the mold compound holds the thermally conducting body in the opening.\"  (App. Br. 8).    Because Hosoyamada\\u2019s prior art package and Appellants\\' claimed package are substantially identical in structure (both show the molding compound attached to multiple sides of the thermally conducting body) a prima facie case of anticipation has been established.3  (See Hosoyamada Fig. 6; Appellants\\u2019 Fig. 5).  Notwithstanding Appellants\\' arguments, we find the weight of the evidence supports the Examiner\\'s finding of anticipation.  R2. CLAIM 1 UNDER \\xa7 103  Appellants contend it would not have been obvious to combine Shin\\'s Figure 7 package with the IC die facing in a die-up orientation with Khan\\'s thermal conducting body facing in a die-down orientation.  (Emphasis added; Request 5-6, App. Br. 16).  Appellants further contend Khan\\'s                                            3 Where the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, a prima facie case of either anticipation or obviousness has been established. In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977). \\u201cWhen the PTO shows a sound basis for believing that the products of the applicant and the prior art are the same, the applicant has the burden of showing that they are not.\\u201d In re Spada, 911 F.2d 705, 709, 15 USPQ2d 1655, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 1990).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004594 Application 11/583,718   5efficient power delivery advantage that metal interposer 1450 offers to the die-down orientation ball grid array package 1400 is not applicable to Shin\\'s Fig. 7 package\\'s die-up orientation.  (Emphasis added; Request 5-6, App. Br. 16).   Appellants\\' contentions are not persuasive as they are premised only on Shin\\'s Figure 7 die-up orientation embodiment and fail to consider Shin\\'s teachings of both die-up (Fig. 7) and die-down (Fig. 5) orientations.  (Request 6; App. Br. 16; Ans. 9, 5-6).  The Examiner finds and we agree, \"Shin teaches package devices with a IC die within the substrate opening, where the solder balls are formed on the underside of the substrate; and that package device can be either die-down or die-up package, as shown in Figs. 7 and 5.\"  (Ans. 9).  Furthermore, the Examiner\\'s cited motivation for the modification of Shin and Khan, both die-down orientations, would provide an efficient power delivery structure because the combined Shin and Khan packages can maintain Khan\\'s die-down orientation as shown in Khan\\u2019s Figure 14.4  (Khan \\xb6[0005]; Ans. 5-6, 9).  Furthermore, it would have been obvious to try both the die-up and die-down orientations because there are only two options (1) die-up and (2) die-down.5                                             4 We note Khan discloses both die-up and die-down embodiments, which provide efficient power delivery.  (Khan Figs. 5 and 14; \\xb6[0005).  Moreover, at least some of Khan\\'s efficient power delivery benefits result from mounting the die to the thermal conducting body, which applies to both the die-up or die-down embodiments. (Id.). 5 When there \\u2026 are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely that product [was] not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense. In that instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004594 Application 11/583,718   6 We also find the Examiner\\'s proffered combination of Shin\\'s package with Khan\\'s thermal conducting body and die would have been a combination of familiar elements according to known methods that would have yielded predictable results.6  (Ans. 5-6, 9).    Notwithstanding Appellants\\' arguments, we find the weight of the evidence supports the Examiner\\'s underlying factual findings and ultimate legal conclusion of obviousness regarding rejection R2.   CONCLUSION We have considered the arguments raised by Appellants in the Request for Rehearing, but Appellants have not persuaded us that we misapprehended or overlooked any points in rendering our Decision.    DECISION We have granted Appellants\\' request to the extent that we have reconsidered our Decision, but we deny the request with respect to making any changes therein.                                                                                                                                that it was obvious under \\xa7 103.  KSR Int\\'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 420 (2007)  6 \\u201cThe combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results.\\u201d  KSR Int\\'l. Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416 (2007).  \\u201cIf a person of ordinary skill can implement a predictable variation, \\xa7 103 likely bars its patentability.\\u201d  Id. at 417.  Thus, we conclude that claiming a mere plurality of prior art elements used in combination is not a nonobvious distinction over the prior art of record, absent some showing of secondary considerations, such as unexpected results.    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-004594 Application 11/583,718   7No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a).

Cir. 1990):\\n\\nThe law is replete witl1 cases in wl1icl1 the difference between\\nthe claimed invention and the prior art is some range or other\\nvariable within the claims. . . . These cases l1ave consistently\\nheld that in such a situation, the applicant must show that the\\nparticular range is critical, generally by showing that the\\nclaimed range achieves unexpected results relative to the prior\\nart range [citations omitted].\\n\\nAppellants assert that the spacing of the elements is essential to the\\nsecurity of the fence panel and to the ability to easily see through it, and that\\nthe weight and size of the fence panel are essential to the stability, ease of\\ninstallation, potential uses, and method of manufacture and installation of\\nthe fence panel. App. Br. 18-19. However, as pointed out by the Examiner,\\nAppellant does not provide any evidence that establishes such criticality.\\nAns. 19. Appellant\\u2019s response amounts to unsupported attorney argument,\\nand therefore we give it little weight. In re Geisler, 1 16 F.3d 1465, 1470\\n(Fed. Cir. 1997).

Ans. 3-4. We agree with Appellant that the disclosure\\n\\nof the second a11d third sets of Vertical wires being \\u201cspot\\u2014welded\\u201d to the first\\n\\nand second sides, respectively, of the panel formed by the horizontal wires\\n\\n3 The Examiner did not specify the subsection of \\xa7 102.\\n\\n3Appeal 2011-013083\\nApplication 11/410,991\\nsupports tl1e \\u201cpermanently \\ufb01xed\\u201d limitation of claim 1. See App. Br. 9;\\nSpec. 5.\\nThe Examiner asserts that \\u201c[t]here is nothing about \\u2018spot-welded\\u2019 that\\n\\nan\\n\\ninherently signi\\ufb01es \\u2018permanent, a11d that the fact that the wires of the prior\\nart panel of Appellant\\u2019s \\ufb01gure 2 call be broken away \\u201cmakes clear that spot-\\nwelding does not inherently result in the wire elements being permanently\\n\\ufb01xed.\\u201d Ans. 1 1. The Examiner\\u2019s assertions are premised on a construction\\nof the terminology \\u201cpermanently \\ufb01xed\\u201d that is not consistent with the\\nmanner in which this terminology is conventionally understood i11 the art. A\\nwelded connection is conventionally Viewed by persons of ordinary skill in\\nthe art as permanent, as distinguished from releasable, removable, or\\ntemporary connections, because spot-welded elements typically cannot be\\nseparated in a non-destructive 1na11ner. Even assuming the Examiner\\ncorrectly presumes that the wires of the prior art panels desc\\ufb01bed in\\nAppellant\\u2019s Speci\\ufb01cation are \\ufb01xed to one another by spot-welding, the fact\\nthat those wires can be separated by cutting or prying the panel in a manner\\nthat destroys the panel does not show that the wires were other than\\npermanently \\ufb01xed, as that terminology is understood in the art.\\n\\nWe thus do not sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 1-10 under\\n35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112, \\ufb01rst paragraph, as lacking written description.\\n\\nRejection (2) Inde\\ufb01nitenexs\\n\\nThe basis of the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 9 as inde\\ufb01nite is that it\\nis unclear how the \\ufb01rst set of elements, which are de\\ufb01ned in claim 1, from\\nwhich claim 9 depends, as being horizontal, can extend \\u201calong the full\\nheight\\u201d of the panel. Ans. 4. For the reasons set forth i11 the Appeal Brief, at\\n\\npage 9, in lines 1 1-14, the Examiner\\u2019s position is untenable. While no singleAppeal 2011-013083\\n\\nApplication ll/410,991\\n\\nelement of the first set extends the full height of Appellant\\u2019s disclosed panel,\\nthe first \\u201cset\\u201d of horizontal panels, which comprises a plurality of spaced\\nelements, extends the full height of the panel.3\\n\\nWe do not sustain the rejection of claim 9 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112,\\nsecond paragraph.\\n\\nThe Examiner determined that claim 10 is inde\\ufb01nite because it \\u201cis\\nstructurally incomplete because it fails to recite the necessary structural\\ncooperative relationships of the elements and thus merely constitutes a\\ncatalog of elements.\\u201d Ans. 4. The Examiner adds that \\u201cthe only elements\\nset forth by claim 10 are fence panels, yet conventionally, it takes more than\\nfence panels to constitute a fence\\u201d and queries whether a \\u201cfence\\u201d as claimed\\nby Appellant requires only plural panels. Id.\\n\\nAppellant does not present any argument asserting that claim 10 is\\nde\\ufb01nite. Rather, Appellant merely asserts that the invention disclosure is\\nsufficient to satisfy the enablement and best mode requirements of 35 U.S.C.\\n\\xa7 112, \\ufb01rst paragraph. App. Br. 9. Thus, Appellant has waived any\\nargument of error, and We summarily sustain the rejection of claim l0 under\\n35 U.S.C. \\xa7 ll2, second paragraph. See In re Berger, 279 F.3d 975, 984,\\n985 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (holding that the Board did not err in sustaining a\\nrejection under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l l2, second paragraph, when the applicant failed\\nto contest the rejection on appeal); Manual Q/\\u2018Patent Exanrzining Procedure\\n\\n(MPEP) \\xa7 l205.02 (8th ed., Rev. 9, Aug. 2012) (\\u201c[i]fa ground of rejection\\n\\n3 Claim 9, Wl1icl1 appears to be loosely directed to the embodiment (not\\nillustrated) described in the first paragraph on page 7 of the Speci\\ufb01cation,\\nmight be more closely tailored to de\\ufb01ne this embodiment if the \\u201csecond\\u201d set,\\nrather than the \\u201cfirst\\u201d set were recited as extending along the full height of\\nthe panel. Nonetheless, the scope of claim 9 is clear.\\n\\n5Appeal 2011-013083\\nApplication ll/410,991\\nstated by the examiner is 11ot addressed in the appellant\\u2019s brief, that ground\\nof rej ection will be summarily sustained by the Board\\u201d).\\nRejection (3) \\u2014Anlz\\'cz\\'palz\\'0n based on E11217]\\n\\n111 contesting the rejection of claim 1 as anticipated by Br\\ufb01hl,\\nAppellant argues that the Examiner improperly construed the terms\\n\\u201chorizontal\\u201d a11d \\u201cvertical\\u201d i11 claim 1. Speci\\ufb01cally, Appellant asserts that\\nthe Speci\\ufb01cation sets forth a de\\ufb01nition of these terms. App. Br. l0 (quoting\\nSpec. 2, \\ufb01rst para., which states, \\u201c[i]n this speci\\ufb01cation any reference to the\\n\\u2018horizontal\\u2019 or \\u2018vertical\\u2019 orientation of an element, wire or fence panel will\\nbe understood to refer to the fence panel in its operative upright position\\u201d).\\nAccording to Appellant, Br\\ufb01hl discloses a set of vertical wires 6 and two sets\\nof horizontal wires 5, 9 located on opposite sides of the vertical wires, not a\\nset of horizontal elements and two sets of vertical elements located on\\nopposite sides of the horizontal elements, as called for in claim 1. App.\\n\\nBr. 11.\\n\\nAppellant does not convince us that the Examiner erred in reading the\\nhorizontal elements of claim I on elements 6 of Bri\\'1hl\\u2019s panel and reading\\nthe vertical elements of claim 1 on elements 9, 5, and 10. See Ans. 5, 14-15.\\nWhile Br[\\'1hl\\u2019s panel is depicted in \\ufb01gure l as attached to posts 1 and\\ndisposed in an orientation in which the elements 6 extend vertically and the\\nelements 9, 5, and I0 extend horizontally, we do not \\ufb01nd, and Appellant\\ndoes not ide11tify, any structural feature of Br1\\'ihl\\u2019s panel that would prevent\\nits use or operation in an orientation in which the elements 6 extend\\nhorizontally and the elements 9, 5, and 10 extend vertically. As repeatedly\\npoi11ted out by the Examiner, claim l is directed solely to the fence panel,\\n\\nnot to a fence panel as part of a fence assembly, and does not de\\ufb01ne theAppeal 2011-013083\\n\\nApplication 11/410,991\\n\\nelements of the fence panel i11 relation to any structure beyond the panel.\\nSee Ans. 5, 15. A fence panel satisfying the limitations of claim 1 when\\ndisposed in its upright position would 11ot cease to be covered by claim 1\\nsimply because it is laid \\ufb02at for storage or transport or disposed i11 some\\nother orie11tation.\\n\\nFor the above reasons, we sustain the rejection of claim 1 as\\nanticipated by Brtihl.\\n\\nI11 co11testi11g the rejection of claim 2, Appellant argues that Briihl\\ndoes 11ot teach or suggest that the second a11d third sets of elements are spot-\\nWelded to the first set of elements. App. Br. 11-12. The Examiner responds\\nby pointing out that Br\\ufb01hl discloses i11 the Abstract that the elements are\\nspot-welded to one another.4 Ans. 15. Appellant does not contest the\\nExaminer\"s \\ufb01nding. Appellant then reiterates the argument that Brijhl does\\nnot teach second and third sets of vertical elements disposed on either side of\\na set of horizontal elements. App. Br. 12. This argument is not convincing,\\nfor the reasons set forth above in regard to claim 1.\\n\\nAppel1ant\\u2019s arguments do not apprise us of error in the Examiner\\u2019s\\nrejection of claim 2 as anticipated by Briihl. We sustain the rejection.\\n\\nClaim 9 recites that\\n\\nthe third set of elongate elements extends partway along the\\nheight of the panel and the first set extends along the full height\\nof the panel to form a fence panel having single vertical\\nelongate elements at its operatively upper section and pairs of\\nvertical elongate elements at its operatively lower section.\\n\\n4 Br1\\'jhl\"s Abstract, at line 20, includes the term \\u201cPunktscliwei\\ufb01ung,\\u201d Wl1icl1\\ntranslates into the English language as \\u201cspot welding.\\u201d Spot welding.

Appellant\\u2019s assertion mischaracterizes what claim 9\\nrequires. Claim 9 requires a panel \\u201chaving single Vertical elongate elements\\nat its operatively upper section,\\u201d but, notably, does not specify that the panel\\nhas only single Vertical elongate elements at its operatively upper section.\\nAs perhaps best illustrated in BrLihl\\u2019s \\ufb01gures 1-3, BrLihl\\u2019s panel comprises\\nsingle elongate elements 5 and 10 that extend across the entire extent of the\\npanel and thus are disposed at the panel\\u2019s operatively upper section. BrLihl\\u2019s\\npanel further comprises pairs of elongate elements 9, which extend across\\nthe entire extent of the panel, and thus are disposed at the panel\\u2019s operatively\\nlower section. Thus, BrLihl\\u2019s panel satis\\ufb01es the limitations of claim 9.\\n\\nWe sustain the rejection of claim 9 as anticipated by Briihl.\\n\\nRejection (4) \\u2014 ()bvi0usI7ess based on Brit\"/7/ and Coley\\n\\nThe Examiner determined it would have been obvious to form the\\nwire of Br1\\'jhl\\u2019s fence panel from high tensile strength steel wire as taugl1t by\\nColey \\u201cin order to construct a strong fence with a good transmitter of\\nelectricity.\\u201d Ans. 9.\\n\\nAppellant argues that \\u201cColey does Q teach the use of fence panels or\\n\\nthe structure of the present invention and does nothing to fill the gaps inAppeal 2011-013083\\n\\nApplication ll/4l0,99l\\n\\n[Br1\\'jhl].\\u201d App. Br. 17. This argument ostensibly is premised 011 the\\narguments asserted against the rejection of claim I, which, for the reasons\\nset forth above, do not apprise us of error in the EXaminer\"s rejection.\\n\\nAppellant adds that \\u201cColey teaches away from the use of high-tensile\\nsteel wire.\\u201d App. Br. 17. We do not agree with Appellant.\\n\\n\\u201cA reference may be said to teach away when a person of ordinary\\nskill, upon reading the reference, would be discouraged from following the\\npath set out in the reference, or would be led in a direction divergent from\\nthe path that was taken by the applicant.\\u201d In re Gurley, 27 F.3d 551, 553\\n(Fed. Cir. l994). Coley teaches that galvanized higl1\\u2014tensile steel wire is a\\ncommonly used electric fence wire. Col. 2, ll. 51-53. Coley also teaches\\nthat galvanized hi gh-tensile steel wire is \\u201cstrong and a good transmitter of\\nelectricity.\\u201d Col. 2, ll. 53-54. These teachings provide rational\\nunderpinnings for the Examiner\\u2019s articulated reason for the combination.\\n\\nColey also poi11ts out shortcomings of galvanized l1igl1-tensile steel wire for\\n\\ntemporary fencing, namely, its low visibility and dif\\ufb01culty in handling. Col.\\n\\n2, ll. 54-56. However, this is not a teaching away, because \\u201c[t]he fact that\\nthe motivating bene\\ufb01t comes at the expense of another benefit, . . . should\\nnot nullify its use as a basis to modify the disclosure of one reference with\\nthe teachings of another. lnstead, the benefits, both lost and gained, should\\nbe weighed against one another.\\u201d Winner [nl\\u2019l Royally Corp. 12. Wang, 202\\nF.3d l340, 1349 n.8 (Fed. Cir. 2000). As pointed out by the Examiner,\\nColey clearly teaches that any shortcoming with respect to visibility may be\\novercome by attaching \\ufb02ags or tape to the wire to enhance visibility.

Discussion\\n\\nFindings of fact throughout this Opinion are supported by a\\n\\npreponderance of the evidence of record.\\n\\nInitially, we find that Panasonic presents separate arguments for the\\npatentability of claims 1 and 15. The respective dependent claims are not\\nargued separately, and they therefore stand or fall with the independent\\n\\nclaims.\\n\\nBrie\\ufb02y, the Examiner \\ufb01nds that N akatani 756 describes silicon\\nsubstrates useful as components of a11 extracellular potential sensing element\\nthat are similar to those recited in the appealed claims. The reference\\nsubstrates are not described as comprising a single crystal plate having a\\ndiamond structure Witl1 (100) plane orientation.\\u201d Moreover, the through-\\nholes i11 the Nakatani 756 substrates are described as having diameters\\nof5 um to 100 um. (Nakatani 756 at 4 [OO76]; cf FR 4, 11. 4-7; Ans. 7,\\n\\n11. 1-4.)\\n\\nThe Examiner finds that Lin describes the (100) face of silicon\\ncrystals having a diamond structure as being rapidly etched. (FR 3, 11. 8-10;\\nAns. 6, 11. 6-9, both citing Lin col. 4, 11. 10-35.) Lin explains that the higher\\netch rate is expected because the atoms forming the (111)-plane of the\\ndiamond lattice of silicon are more densely packed than the atoms ill the\\n\\n(100)-plane. (Lin, col. 4, 11. 28-32; off.\\u2019 Spec. 12, 11. 5-19, discussing the\\n\\nH We interpret this limitation as requiring that the \\ufb02at upward-facing face of\\nthe plate be the (100) face of the crystal. For completeness, we take of\\ufb01cial\\nnotice that silicon, in column 14 of the Periodic Table, directly under carbo11,\\nforms crystals having the same (diamond) structure.Appeal 2012-005846\\nApplication 1 1/913,1 16\\n\\ndensity and bonding of silico11 atoms in the (100) and (111) planes, a11d tl1e\\nrelative rates of etching). The Examiner concludes that it would have been\\nobvious to use a plate of si11gle crystal silicon oriented in the (100) direction\\nto take advantage of the known rapid etching property. (FR 3, ll. l 1-] 5;\\nAns. 7, 11. 9-13.)\\n\\nThe Examiner finds that Oka describes silicon substrates similar to\\nthose described by Nakatani 756, but having 3-um diameter through-holes.\\n(FR 4, ll. 8-l0; Ans. 7, ll. 5-7, both citing Oka [0l27].) The Examiner\\nconcludes that it would l1ave been obvious to use 3- pm diameter through-\\nholes, as suggested by Oka, in place of the 5-pm through-holes described by\\nNakatani 756. (FR 4, 11. 11-16; Ans. 7, 11. 8-13.)\\n\\nPanasonic focuses its principal arguments on the teachings of prior art\\nreferences Nakatani 756 and Oka, which, Panasonic argues, the Examiner\\nhas misapprehended by failing to give adequate weight to the Declaration\\n\\ufb01led by co-inventor Masaya Nakataniu\\u2019 13 Mr. Nakatani testifies that the\\ndisclosure in the l 16 Speci\\ufb01cation is accurate\\u2014that when [isotropically]\\netching a substrate through mask holes having a diameter of 3 pm or less,\\nthe surface roughness of the resulting depression was hi gh, and the\\nsymmetry of tl1e depression was low. (Declaration 3 $1 12.) According to\\nMr. Nakatani, when a substrate with a diamond lattice with (l 00) orientation\\n\\nis [isotropically] etched, the resulting depression is symmetric and l1as\\n\\n12 Declaration by Masaya N akatani, \\ufb01led during examination a11d attached to\\nthe principal Brief on Appeal in the Evidence Appendix (\\u201cDeclaration\\u201d).\\n\\n13 As Panasonic indicates (Br. 6, last para.), 11amed inventor and declarant\\nMasaya Nakatani is the first-named inventor of the Nakatani 756 reference.Appeal 2012-005846\\nApplication 1 1/913,1 16\\n\\nreduced surface rougl111ess. (Id. at\\ufb01l 14, citing the Speci\\ufb01cation, page 11,\\nlines 7-18.) Mr. Nakatani concludes that it would not have been obvious to\\n\\nuse masks having holes witl1 less than 3 um, as taugl1t by Oka. (Id. at 4,\\n\\n\\u2018H11 20-23.)\\n\\nPanasonic urges further that the routineer \\u201ccould not have known from\\nreading Lin that using the through-hole of Oka witl1 N akatani would remove\\n\\nthe undesirable surface roughness.\\u201d (Br. 7, 11. 18-20 (emphasis o1nitted).)\\n\\nThese arguments are not persuasive of l1ar1nful error. First, Panasonic\\nhas not shown that the references would have indicated a problem with\\netching through smaller mask holes. Indeed, not only does Oka provide a\\nworking example of a substrate having a through-hole having a diameter\\nof 3 um iii the bottom of a depression having a11 opening diameter of 20 um\\nand a depth of 10 um (Oka 8 [0027] (Example 1, Fig. 3), Oka also teaches\\n(id. at 2 [O022]) and claims (id. at I 1, claim 5) through-hole diameters\\nranging from 2 to 10 um, formed by methods illustrated in Figs. 2(a)-2(g)\\nand described at page 6 [0102]-[01 05]. Based on the teachings of Oka, it\\ncannot be said the Examiner erred harmfully in concluding that the prior art\\nof record would have indicated to the routineer that acceptable results would\\nl1ave been obtained using the anisotropic etching method described by\\n\\nNakatani at page 6 [01 18] and illustrated in Fig. 32, shown on the following\\npage.Appeal 2012-005846\\nApplication 1 1/913,1 16\\n\\n{Nakatani Fig. 32 is sl1ow11 belowz}\\n\\n \\n\\n{Nakatani Fig. 32 shows anisotropic etching through mask 30 to form\\nthrough-holes 3 at the bottom of depressions 4 in silicon substrate 28}\\n\\nI11 Nal<atani\\u2019s words, \\u201cthe etching [using a mixture of accelerating gas a11d\\nretarding gas] proceeds anisotropically only in the vertica//y\\u2014a\\u20190wn a\\u2019irectz\\'0n;\\nso, throughhole 3 is formed starting at the bottom of depression 4.\\u201d\\n\\n((Id. at 6 [O1 18]; emphasis added.) Thus, the routi11eer would have had a\\nbasis to expect, reasonably, the enablement of the entire range of thr0ugl1\\u2014\\nholes described by Oka, based 011 the further teachings, available about three\\n\\nyears later, of Nakatani.\\n\\nNor l1as Panasonic demonstrated harmful error in the EXaminer\"s\\nconclusion that it would l1ave been obvious to use a single crystal\\n(lO0)\\u2014oriented plate in place of tl1e (uncharacterized) plates used by Oka or\\nby Nakatani in order to take advantage of the rapid etching of (100) oriented\\nplates taught by Lin. It is well-settled that the reasons for combining\\nreferences need 11ot be the same as the reasons underlying Appellants\\u2019\\n\\nclaimed invention. In re Beatlie, 974 F.2d 1309, 1312 (Fed.

Moreover, neither\\nthe Declaration nor the Specification provides any Working examples.\\nWhile examples are not necessary for an enabling description of the\\ninvention, it was not error for the Examiner to decline to credit unsupported\\nstatements of unexpected results in the Specification in the evaluation of\\nobviousness.

(Appellants) appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 from a final rejection of claims 22-28 and 30.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We AFFIRM.  CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER The claimed subject matter relates to \\u201ca safety cabinet for flammable, combustible, or other hazardous materials.\\u201d  See Spec., para. [0002].  Claim 22 represents the subject matter on appeal and is reproduced below with the key disputed limitation emphasized. 22.  A safety cabinet for storing hazardous material in a facility, the safety cabinet comprising: a cabinet enclosure defining an opening and a cavity for storing the hazardous material, the enclosure including an external surface; a door rotatably attached to the cabinet enclosure, the door movable between an open position and a closed position, the door configured to selectively cover at least part of the opening of the enclosure when in the closed position; and a reflective hazard indicator disposed on the external surface of the cabinet enclosure, the indicator including indicia adapted to convey information about the flammable nature of the hazardous material stored in the enclosure, and the indicia comprises a retroreflective material adapted such that at least a portion of incident light striking the material is redirected toward its originating source. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012286 Application 11/593,422  3 EVIDENCE The Examiner relies on the following evidence:   Joyner   U.S. 2,592,289  Apr. 8, 1952 Schmid   U.S. 4,106,229  Aug. 15, 1978 Gillispie   U.S. 5,944,399  Aug. 31, 1999 Northey   U.S. 6,470,610 B1  Oct. 29, 2002  REJECTIONS Claims 22-28 and 30 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Gillispie, Schmid, and Northey.  Ans. 3. Claims 22 and 23 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Gillispie, Joyner, and Northey.  Ans. 5. ANALYSIS Rejection over Gillispie, Schmid, and Northey Appellants argue claims 22-28 and 30 as a group.  App. Br. 8-9.  We select claim 22 as representative, and claims 23-28 and 30 stand or fall with claim 22.  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii) (2011). The Examiner finds that Gillispie teaches a safety cabinet including all of the limitations set forth in claim 22, except for a hazard indicator comprising a reflective material and indicia to convey information about the nature of the hazardous material stored in the cabinet.  Ans. 3-4. The Examiner finds that Schmid, however, teaches a hazard indicator disposed on an external surface of a cabinet that includes indicia 15, 16 to convey information about the nature of the hazardous material stored in the cabinet, and that Northey teaches an indicator 52 having a retroreflective material 58 adapted such that at least a portion of incident light striking the \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012286 Application 11/593,422  4 material is redirected toward its originating source.  Ans. 4.  The Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to include Schmid\\u2019s indicator on an external surface of Gillispie\\u2019s cabinet to improve user safety, and that it would have been obvious to make at least a portion of the indicator reflective, as taught by Northey, to improve the visibility thereof.  Id. Appellants argue that Gillispie fails to disclose a reflective hazard indicator disposed on an external surface of the cabinet, and \\u201cthe secondary references\\u201d fail to make up for the deficiencies in Gillispie and do not provide an appropriate reason to combine elements from their disclosures to arrive at a safety cabinet for storing hazardous material in a facility as recited in claim 22.  App. Br. 6. Appellants argue that Schmid is solely concerned with devising a sign holder for a truck to \\u201csecurely retain the placard on a truck without covering the mandatory border area and blocking it from view,\\u201d and provides no reason to use its concepts on anything other than a truck.  App. Br. 6-7.  Appellants also argue that Schmid does not teach the indicator including a retroreflective material as claimed.  App. Br. 7.  Appellants also argue that Northey is concerned with constructing a prefabricated retroreflective sign that is resistant to moisture and dirt, and therefore fails to disclose or suggest a hazard indicator for use on a safety cabinet.  Id.     In response to Appellants\\u2019 arguments that Northey fails to disclose or suggest a hazard indicator for use on a safety cabinet, and that Schmid makes no reference to its placard 13 including a reflective portion, the \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012286 Application 11/593,422  5 Examiner responds that Appellants cannot show non-obviousness by attacking references individually where the rejections are based on combinations of references.  Ans. 9.  We agree with the Examiner.  We are not persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 attacks on individual references given that the rejection is based on a combination of references.   Appellants also argue that the Examiner fails to provide a credible reason for one skilled in the art to modify Schmid\\u2019s truck sign holder to include a reflective hazard indicator as claimed, and then to modify Gillispie\\u2019s safety cabinet to include Schmid\\u2019s modified sign holder.  Id.  According to Appellants, Northey fails to mention any advantage that might be attained by using a retroreflective material in an application other than on an outdoor sign that may be struck by light from vehicle headlamps (App. Br. 7-8) and neither Schmid nor Northey teach or suggest modifying Gillispie\\u2019s safety cabinet by adding a hazard indicator including a retroreflective material (App. Br. 8). The Examiner responds that Schmid is viewed, broadly, as teaching a hazard indicator for a hazardous material container to provide advance warning to persons opening the container, and that one of ordinary skill would understand that hazardous material is found in a variety of containers, including the truck of Schmid and the cabinet of Gillispie, and that providing persons with advance warning regarding the hazardous nature of the materials in a container would increase user safety.  Ans. 7.  The Examiner states that, moreover, one of ordinary skill would recognize that Schmid's hazard indicator is usable on containers other than a truck to achieve the predictable result of increasing user safety by providing users with advance warning regarding the hazardous nature of the container's contents.  Id. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012286 Application 11/593,422  6 In response to Appellants\\u2019 argument that Northey does not provide a reason to use its retroreflective material for an indoor sign, the Examiner notes that motivation to combine the teachings of the prior art need not be found in the applied references, but rather can be found in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art.  Ans. 7 (citing In re Fine, 837 F.2d 1071 (Fed. Cir. 1988)).  The Examiner concludes that one of ordinary skill would understand that increasing the visibility of Schmid's hazard indicator is desirable, and that adding known retroreflective material to a hazard indicator would \\u201cyield the predictable result of making said hazard indicator more visible to users employing artificial light sources (e.g., flashlights)\\u201d even when the container is indoors and despite the existence of typical overhead indoor lighting.  Ans. 8-9. Appellants argue that the Examiner\\u2019s reason for combining Gillispie, Schmid, and Northey impermissibly used hindsight.  App. Br. 5 and 8.  The Examiner responds that any judgment on obviousness is in a sense necessarily a reconstruction based upon hindsight reasoning; but so long as it takes into account only knowledge which was within the level of ordinary skill at the time the claimed invention was made, and does not include knowledge gleaned only from Appellants\\u2019 disclosure, such a reconstruction is proper.  Ans. 9 (citing In re McLaughlin, 443 F.2d 1392 (CCPA 1971)).   In the Reply Brief, Appellants again argue that the applied references fail to establish that one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of Appellants\\u2019 invention would have found it obvious to use a retroreflective hazard indicator in a safety cabinet for storing hazardous material in a facility as described in claim 22, and that it is only through the use of improper hindsight knowledge of the present invention, and its attendant benefits, that \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012286 Application 11/593,422  7 the applied references would be combined at all.  Reply Br. 3.  Because reason to combine the teachings of the prior art need not be found in the applied references, but rather can be found in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art, we are not persuaded by this argument.  Appellants do not persuasively argue that the Examiner\\u2019s above-stated reasons for combining Gillispie, Schmid, and Northey lack a rational basis.  We are not persuaded that the Examiner\\u2019s reasoning impermissibly used hindsight or lacked credibility. For the reasons set forth above, we sustain the rejection of claims 22-28 and 30 as unpatentable over Gillispie, Schmid, and Northey.   Rejection over Gillispie, Joyner, and Northey Appellants make essentially the same arguments regarding Gillispie, Joyner, and Northey, and the combination thereof, that were made with respect to Gillispie, Schmid, and Northey.  For the reasons set forth above with respect to the rejection over Gillispie, Schmid, and Northey, we sustain the rejection of claims 22 and 23.  DECISION We AFFIRM the rejection of claims 22-28 and 30 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Gillispie, Schmid, and Northey. We AFFIRM the rejection of claims 22 and 23 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Gillispie, Joyner, and Northey.     \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012286 Application 11/593,422  8 No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a).

We reverse.                                            1 The Real Party in Interest is EnGeneIC Molecular Delivery Pty. Ltd. (App. Br. 1.) 2 Claims 6, 7, and 9 are also pending, but stand withdrawn from consideration (Reply Br. 3). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003618  Application 11/211,098   2  STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Specification teaches that the invention relates to \\u201cusing bacterial minicell vectors to deliver functional nucleic acids to mammalian cells\\u201d (Spec. 2 \\xb6 [0001]).  The Specification teaches a method of \\u201covercoming drug resistance or apoptosis resistance and treating a malignancy in the subject\\u201d (id. at 5 \\xb6 [0012]).  Preferably, an intact minicell that contains the functional nucleic acid is brought into contact with a target mammalian cell, and then a chemotherapeutic drug is delivered to the target mammalian cell, wherein the chemotherapeutic drug may also be delivered via a minicell (id.).  According to the Specification, the \\u201cinventors . . . have discovered that minicells can sequentially transfect the same target mammalian cells, particularly in vivo, and that minicells can sequentially deliver a range of different payloads to the same target mammalian cells\\u201d (id. at 9 \\xb6 [0024]). Claim 1 is the only independent claim on appeal, and reads as follows: 1. A composition comprising (a) a first intact, bacterially derived minicell that contains a functional nucleic acid molecule or a plasmid comprising a segment that encodes a functional nucleic acid molecule, (b) a second intact, bacterially derived minicell that is separate from said first minicell and that contains a cancer chemotherapy agent, and (c) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for each of (a) and (b), wherein said functional nucleic acid molecule targets a transcript encoding a protein that contributes to resistance to said cancer chemotherapy agent in tumor cells.    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003618  Application 11/211,098   3   The following grounds of rejection are before us for review: I. Claims 1-3, 14, 15, and 20-29 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being rendered obvious by the combination of Sabbadini,3 Hong,4 and Biroccio5 (Ans. 5). II. Claims 1-5, 8, 14, 15, and 20-29 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being rendered obvious by the combination of Sabbadini, Hong, Biroccio, Bridge,6 Bertrand,7 and Wu8 (Ans. 11).  ANALYSIS  The issue as to both obviousness rejections on appeal is the same, and we thus address them together.  The Examiner relies on Sabbadini for teaching a composition comprising an intact minicell that contains an antisense oligonucleotide, such as one targeted to Bcl-2 (Ans. 5-6 (citing Sabbadini, cols. 7, 167, 204, and 205)).  The Examiner finds further that the minicells can be used to                                            3 Sabbadini et al., US 7,183,105 B2, issued Feb. 27, 2007.  4 Hong et al., Antisense Bcl2 oligonucleotide in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cell lines, 90 BJU INTERNATIONAL 113-117 (2002).  5 Biroccio et al., The future of antisense therapy: combination with anticancer treatments, 22 ONCOGENE 6579-6588 (2003).  6 Bridge et al., Induction of an interferon response by RNAi vectors in mammalian cells, 34 NATURE GENETICS 263-264 (2003).  7 Bertrand et al., Comparison of antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs in cell culture and in vivo, 296 BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS 1000-1004 (2002).  8 Wu et al., Small Interfering RNA-induced Suppression of MDR1 (P-Glycoprotein) Restores Sensitivity to Multidrug-resistant Cancer Cells, 63 CANCER RESEARCH 1515-1519 (2003). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003618  Application 11/211,098   4  deliver therapeutic agents, and that kits containing the compositions can have one or more therapeutic agents in combination (Ans. 7).  According to the Examiner, Sabbadini thus teaches that \\u201ctwo or more therapeutic minicell compositions are formulated into the same composition, or are administered during the same therapeutic minicell compositions\\u201d (id. at 9).  The Examiner notes that Sabbadini does not teach \\u201cthat two or more therapeutic minicell compositions are formulated into the same composition, or are administered during [sic] the same therapeutic minicell compositions\\u201d (id.).  According to the Examiner: One of skill in the art would have had a reasonable expectation of success in delivering an anti-cancer agent in one of the minicells within the combination of Sabbadini et al. with resultant enhanced activity between the delivery of the therapeutic nucleic acid targeting bcl-2 and the activity of the anticancer agent itself given the teachings of Sabbadini et al. regarding combining minicells that are delivering agents for the same purpose and the teachings of Biroccio et al. regarding the success of combining antisense treatment with that of conventional chemotherapy agents, wherein Biroccio et al. specifically addresses targeting bcl-2, the same target of Sabbadini et al.  (Id. at 10-11.)  Appellants argue that the claims specify an interrelation between the two payloads of the claimed minicells, and that both minicells must be taken up by the same tumor cell to be effective (App. Br. 7).    According to Appellants, the Examiner\\u2019s rejections are premised on the findings that:  Sabbadini teaches that two minicell compositions may be formulated into a single composition, and thus would result in both minicell compositions being taken up by the same cell; and that Biroccio discloses \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003618  Application 11/211,098   5  combining antisense treatment with conventional chemotherapeutic agents (id. at 9).  Appellants assert that co-administering two minicell compositions to the same patient does not require that the minicell compositions be administered to the same cell, such as when a drug for hypertension is administered with a drug for diabetes (id. at 10-11).  Appellants further assert that prior to the instant application, the understanding in the art was that tumor cells were \\u201clargely incapable of repeated uptake of chemotherapies\\u201d (id. at 11).  Appellants rely on the Declaration of Professor Bryan Williams,9 to support that it was known that cancer cells have impaired capacity in receptor mediated endocytosis (id.).    Specifically, Professor Williams declares, relying on Bache,10 \\u201cthat cancer cells in general have impaired capacity in receptor-mediated endocytosis\\u201d (Williams Decl., \\xb6 8).  Thus, according to Professor Williams, after delivery of a first minicell to a cancer cell, the cancer cells would be expected to develop resistance to uptake a second minicell via endocytosis (id. at \\xb6 9).  Professor Williams thus opines that  [P]ersons working in the field before the effective filing date were not motivated but rather disincentivized to try a therapeutic approach, as set out in the claims, which premised on a serial uptake by a cancer cell of minicell-packaged drug                                               9 Declaration of Professor Bryan Williams, submitted March 7, 2011.  10 Bache et al., Defective downregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases in cancer, 23 THE EMBO JOURNAL 2707-2712, 2711 (2004) (noting that the examples discussed \\u201cpredict a role for impaired endocytosis in cancer\\u201d). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003618  Application 11/211,098   6  payloads; this, because the incidence of such uptake would have been expected to be too low for efficacy.  (Id. at \\xb6 10.)  The Examiner responds that while Appellants argue that \\u201cboth minicells must be taken up by the same tumor cell to be effective, the composition is identical to that of the prior art,\\u201d noting that the claims are drawn to a composition, and not a compound (Ans. 14).  The Examiner also finds that the Declaration of Professor Williams is not commensurate in scope with the claimed subject matter, as the claims are composition claims, and not method claims (id. at 15).  Sabbadini is drawn to \\u201ccompositions and methods for the production of achromosomal archeabacterial, eubacterial and anucleate eukaryotic cells that are used as, e.g., therapeutics and/or diagnostics, reagents in drug discovery and functional proteomics, research tools, and in other applications as well\\u201d (Sabbadini, col. 1, ll. 15-20).  Sabbadini teaches that the minicells may be loaded with a variety of substances, such as therapeutic agents (id. at col. 161, ll. 37-41).  Specifically, Sabbadini teaches: Biologically active agents include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, e.g., DNA, RNA, gene therapy constructs, ribozymes, antisense and other synthetic oligonucleotides including those with chemical modifications; peptide nucleic acids (PNAs); proteins; synthetic oligopeptides; peptomimetics; small molecules; radioisotopes; antibiotics; antibodies and antibody derivatives; and combinations and/ or prodrugs of any of the preceding.  (Id. at col. 161, ll. 41-48.)  Sabbadini teaches that minicells may be used to deliver DNA-based therapy, such an antisense to Bcl-2 (id. at col. 167, ll. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003618  Application 11/211,098   7  14-22).  Sabbadini also teaches kits that may contain one or more therapeutic agents (id. at col. 214, l. 62).  The Examiner does not point to any suggestion in Sabbadini of combining a minicell containing a functional nucleic acid, such as an antisense to Bcl-2, with a second minicell that contains a chemotherapeutic agent, wherein the \\u201cfunctional nucleic acid molecule targets a transcript encoding a protein that contributes to resistance to said cancer chemotherapy agent in tumor cells.\\u201d  (Claim 1.)  Biroccio teaches combining antisense oligonucleotides with conventional anticancer drugs (Biroccio, p. 6580, 2nd col.).  Biroccio does not suggest using minicells.  While we agree with the Examiner that the claims are drawn to a composition, and not a method, independent claim 1 does require that the \\u201cfunctional nucleic acid molecule targets a transcript encoding a protein that contributes to resistance to said cancer chemotherapy agent in tumor cells.\\u201d  That limitation limits the composition to a functional nucleic acid molecule in one of the minicells, wherein the nucleic acid targets a protein that contributes to resistance to the cancer chemotherapy agent in the second minicell.  The Examiner has provided no reason to make such a combination, other than relying on the generic statements in Sabbadini that kits may contain one or more therapeutic agents in minicells, and the teachings of Biroccio regarding the success of combining antisense treatment with that of conventional chemotherapy agents.  Moreover, even if Biroccio may be read to combine a functional nucleic acid with a chemotherapeutic agent, wherein the nucleic acid targets a protein that contributes to resistance to the cancer chemotherapy agent, \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003618  Application 11/211,098   8  Appellants have provided evidence that the ordinary artisan would have not used that combination in separate minicells because after delivery of a first minicell to a cancer cell, the cancer cells would be expected to develop resistance to uptake a second minicell via endocytosis.  That evidence stands unrebutted by the Examiner, except for the Examiner\\u2019s statement that the claims are drawn to a composition rather than a method.  That evidence, however, also provides a reason as to why the ordinary artisan at the time of the invention would not have combined the components of the composition in the manner required by the claim.    SUMMARY We conclude that the Examiner has not demonstrated the obviousness of the claimed compositions by a preponderance of the evidence, and we reverse the rejection of claims 1-3, 14, 15, and 20-29 as being rendered obvious by the combination of Sabbadini, Hong, and Biroccio, as well as the rejection of claims 1-5, 8, 14, 15, and 20-29 as being rendered obvious by the combination of Sabbadini, Hong, Biroccio, Bridge, Bertrand, and Wu.

The\\nExaminer l1as found that Tanaka or Oswald teaches a textured transparent\\nconductive layer deposited on a substrate for use in forming photoelectric\\ndevices. (Ans. 5-6.) Although the Examiner has acknowledged that neither\\nTanaka nor Oswald teaches a surface morphology de\\ufb01ning a sequence of\\nhumps and hollows, including \\ufb02anks, with said hollows having \\u201ca rounded\\nbase with a radius of greater than 25 nm\\u201d as recited in claim ll, the\\nExaminer has concluded that such surface morphology is either inherent or\\nobvious in light of the teachings of Tanaka or Oswald, as evidenced by\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 own disclosure in the Speci\\ufb01cation. (Id.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, Appellants contend that the Examiner has not\\ndemonstrated that such surface morphology is either inherent or obvious in\\nlight of the teachings of Tanaka or Oswald, as evidenced by Appellants\\u2019 own\\ndisclosure in the Speci\\ufb01cation. (App. Br. 6-20.)\\n\\nThus, the dispositive question raised here is: Has the Examiner\\ndemonstrated that Tanaka or Oswald, as evidenced by Applicants\\u2019 disclosure\\n\\nin the Speci\\ufb01cation, 7 inherently teaches or would l1ave suggested a textured\\n\\n7 The Examiner has not relied upon the disclosure of Middelman or Meier to\\nestablish inl1ere11cy or obviousness of the surface morphology recited in\\nindependent claim l l, the broadest claim on appeal. (Ans. 7-9.)Appeal 2012-007123\\nApplication 12/294,936\\n\\ntransparent conductive layer having the surface morphology recited in claim\\n\\nll? On this record, we answer this question in the negative.\\n\\nThere is no dispute that Tanaka or Oswald, like Appellants, discloses\\nchemical deposition, such as CVD and sputtering, followed by plasma\\netching, to form a textured transparent conductive layer deposited on a\\nsubstrate. (Compare Ans. 5-6 with App. Br. 6-20.) However, as indicated\\nby the portions of the Speci\\ufb01cation relied upon by the Examiner, to obtain\\nthe surface morphology recited in claim 11, the deposition and etching\\nconditions for the transparent conductive layer need to be appropriately\\nselected. (Spec. 6, l. 30 to 10, .l. 9.) Nevertheless, the Examiner has not\\nidenti\\ufb01ed any chemical deposition and etching conditions in Tanaka or\\nOswald which inherently produce or are reasonably expected to produce the\\ntype of the surface morphology recited in claim ll.8 (Ans. 5-34.) Nor has\\nthe Examiner shown that Tanaka or Oswald teaches that the type of the\\nsurface morphology recited in claim l 1, such as the shape and radius size of\\nhollows, is a result effective van\\'able. (Id.) Moreover, the disclosures in the\\nSpecification relied upon by the Examiner do 11ot i11dicate that such\\ndeposition and etching conditions useful for forming the surface morphology\\n\\nrecited in claim 1 l were known to those skilled in the art at the time of the\\n\\n8 Although the Examiner has referred to Tanaka\\u2019s teaching of smoothing\\ndow11 the rough surface or the tips or extremities of sharp protrusions of the\\nsurface via mechanical polishing or bombardment by ions accelerated by\\ndischarge, the Examiner has not established that such smoothing necessarily\\nor inherently causes or would l1aVe suggested the formation of a surface\\nmorphology de\\ufb01ned by a sequence of humps and hollows, with said hollows\\n(valleys, 11ot tips) having \\u201ca rounded base with a radius of greater than 25\\nnm\\u201d a11d \\u201cmicroroughnesses having a11 average height of 5 nm\\u201d as recited i11\\nclaim 1 l.Appeal 2012-007123\\nApplication 12/294,936\\n\\ninvention or were employed in Tanaka or Oswald to inherently provide the\\n\\nsurface morphology recited i11 claim 11. (Spec. 3-10.)\\n\\nAccordingly, on the present facts, we concur with Appellants that the\\nExaminer has not carn\\'ed the burden of establishing a prima facie case of\\nunpatentability based 011 inherency or obviousness. See Ex parle Levy, 17\\nUSPQ2d 1461, I464 (BPAI 1990) (When an examiner relies upon a theory\\nof inherency, \\u201cthe examiner must provide a basis i11 fact and/or technical\\nreasoning to reasonably support the determination that the allegedly inherent\\ncharacteristic necessarily flows from the teachings of the applied prior art\\u201d);\\nIn re Robertson, 169 F.3d 743, 745 (Fed.

BEST, Administrative Patent Judges.  HASTINGS, Administrative Patent Judge.  DECISION ON APPEAL  Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 from the Examiner\\u2019s final rejection under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) of claims 1-8, 10-15, and 17-23 as obvious over Nelson \\u02bc4301 with Chien;2 and of claims 9 and 16 as obvious over Nelson 430, Chien, and Nelson \\u02bc408.3  We have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).                                            1 US 2002/0127430 A1 published September 12, 2002.  Nelson \\u02bc430 shares a common inventor with the present case on appeal. 2 US 5,775,016 patented July 7, 1998. 3 US 6,395,408 B1 patented May 28, 2002. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005063 Application 11/504,266   2Claim 1 is illustrative of the claimed subject matter: 1. A decorative laminate, comprising: a core layer having at least one sheet of paper impregnated with a resin; and  a decorative layer having at least one sheet of paper with at least first and second geometric patterns printed thereon, which first geometric pattern is printed using a first photoluminescent material, and which second geometric pattern is printed using a second photoluminescent material;  wherein the first photoluminescent material produces a first color when exposed to ultraviolet light, and the second photoluminescent material produces a second color when exposed to ultraviolet light, which second color is different from the first color.  Each independent claim (i.e., claims 1, 10, 17, 20, and 22) similarly requires a first and a second photoluminescent material producing two different colors in a decorative laminate, or in a method for making a decorative laminate (Claims App\\u2019x).   Appellants rely upon the same arguments regarding the use of two different photoluminescent colors for each independent claim, and do not present any separate arguments for any specific claim (Br. 6-11).  Accordingly, we select claim 1 as representative. ANALYSIS We have thoroughly reviewed each of Appellants\\u2019 arguments for patentability.  However, we agree with the Examiner that the claimed subject matter of representative claim 1 would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art within the meaning of \\xa7 103 in view of the applied prior art.  Accordingly, we will sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejections for these claims for \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005063 Application 11/504,266   3essentially those reasons expressed in the Answer, and we add the following primarily for emphasis.   It is well established that \\u201c[a] person of ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton.\\u201d  KSR Int\\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 421 (2007).  The obviousness analysis need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the claim, for it is proper to take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ.  Id. at 418.  Furthermore, an improvement in the art is obvious if \\u201cit is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense.\\u201d  Id. at 421.   We are not persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 arguments that there is no suggestion of using more than one photoluminescent material in the applied prior art (Br. 8).  There is no dispute that Nelson \\u02bc430 discloses the claimed subject matter of a decorative laminate and method of forming such a laminate except for an explicit teaching of using two different photoluminescent materials/colors as recited in each independent claim.4  The Examiner relies upon Chien mainly to exemplify that photoluminescent materials that produce a variety of colors are well known (e.g., Ans. 5).                                              4 We also agree with the Examiner that the claimed design may be properly characterized as nonfunctional descriptive material (e.g., Ans. 13).  In the context of prior art rejections, a distinction over the prior art based on nonfunctional descriptive material is patentably inconsequential.  See In re Ngai, 367 F.3d 1336, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also In re Gulack, 703 F.2d 1381, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (when descriptive material is not functionally related to the substrate, the descriptive material will not distinguish the invention from the prior art in terms of patentability).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005063 Application 11/504,266   4We have no doubt that the use of two different  photoluminescent materials in order to produce two different colors in a decorative laminate would have been within the level of ordinary creativity in the art based on the applied prior art of Nelson \\u02bc430, with or without Chien.  See Perfect Web Techs., Inc. v. InfoUSA, Inc., 587 F.3d 1324, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\\u201cWe therefore hold that while an analysis of obviousness always depends on evidence that supports the required Graham factual findings, it also may include recourse to logic, judgment, and common sense available to the person of ordinary skill that do not necessarily require explication in any reference or expert opinion.\\u201d).5 Appellants have not presented any persuasive reasoning or evidence that the use of two photoluminescent materials/colors in Nelson \\u02bc430 would not have been within the level of skill in the art as discussed above and in the Examiner\\u2019s Answer.   Appellants also contend that the \\u201cutility [of providing safety information to a bowler] is not possible with either prior art reference\\u201d (Br. 8).  This is not persuasive, since the decorative laminate as claimed (and method of forming same) is not limited to any particular application.  Furthermore, Nelson \\u02bc430 exemplifies a wide variety of uses for its decorative laminate, including for bowling lanes (Nelson \\u02bc430 Abstract).   The Examiner\\u2019s decision is affirmed.                                              5 See also DyStar Textilfarben GmbH & Co. Deutschland KG v. C.H. Patrick Co., 464 F.3d 1356, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (\\u201cOur suggestion test is in actuality quite flexible and not only permits, but requires, consideration of common knowledge and common sense.\\u201d). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005063 Application 11/504,266   5 No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a).

A bacterial strain producing polyhydroxyalkanoates wherein the bacterial strain is selected from the group consisting of Ralstonia eutropha, Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli and is genetically modified to express a heterologous nuclease gene, wherein the nuclease is secreted into the periplasmic space and released when the bacteria is lysed, wherein the bacteria expresses a nuclease which is secreted into the periplasmic space in an amount effective to degrade at least 95% of all of the nucleic acid released following lysis of the cells in less than 24 hours and reduce the viscosity of a cell lysate in a bacterial cell culture having a density of at least 50 g/l so that recovery of product is enhanced.  7.  A bacterial strain producing polyhydroxyalkanoates, wherein the bacterial strain is selected from the group consisting of Ralstonia eutropha, Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli and is genetically modified to express a heterologous nuclease gene integrated into the chromosome of the bacterial host, wherein the nuclease is secreted into the periplasmic space and released when the bacteria is lysed, wherein the bacteria expresses a nuclease which is secreted into the periplasmic space in an amount effective to degrade at least 95% of all of the nucleic acid released following lysis of the cells in less than 24 hours.

Grounds of Rejection Claims 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Greer, Atkinson, and Lee in view of Liebl or Miller.  FINDINGS OF FACT The Examiner\\u2019s findings of fact are set forth in the Answer at pages 4-8.  Discussion   ISSUE The Examiner concludes that   One of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to genetically engineer a Alcaligenes eutrophus (Ralsotnia [sic] eutropha) polyhydroxyalkanoates producing bacterial strain, as taught by Atkinson et al., to express the Staphylococcal aureus nuclease as taught by Liebl et al. or                                                                                                                               g/l and produce P(3HB) at 61.5 g/l, or 80% wt/wt of dry cell mass, page 30 through 32).\\u201d  This reference citation, however, is from Lee page 32, section 3.2, not Atkinson pages 30-32. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005719  Application 10/607,903    4Miller et al. or a homologous nuclease gene that has been modified to enhance nuclease activity, so that this bacterial strain would express a nuclease which is secreted into the periplasmic space in an amount effective to degrade at least 95% of all the nucleic acid released following lysis of the cells in less than 24 hours and reduce the viscosity of a cell lysate in a bacterial cell culture having a density of at least 50 g/l so that recovery of product is enhanced. The expression of such a nuclease could be from a plasmid DNA or from genetic material integrated into host chromosome.  A nuclease excreted into the medium as a result of such a genetically engineered bacterial strain would inherently result in the degradation of at least 95% of all the nucleic acid released following lysis of the cells in less than 24 hours.  The motivation for producing a nuclease by a genetically engineered bacterial strain used in the fermentation process is to reduce the amount of nucleic acids in the medium which result in an increase in the viscosity of the medium, causing problems in the downstream processing steps, as taught by Greer et al. Greer et al. give further motivation for genetically engineering a bacterial strain to express a nuclease, because they teach that purified preparations of nucleases are expensive and a bacterial strain that was genetically engineered to express a nuclease activity would not require an external nuclease or hydrogen peroxide to be added to the fermentation. One would have had a reasonable expectation of success because both Liebl et al. and Miller et al. were able to express functional Staphylococcal aureus nuclease in different bacterial species, specifically Corynebacterium glutamicum and Bacillus subtilis and Liebl et al. teach that the Staphylococcal aureus nuclease is a heat-stable biochemically well characterized enzyme.  One would have been further motivated to engineer the bacterial strain to excrete/secrete the nuclease into the growth medium following cell lysis, in an effective amount to enhance the recovery of product from the growth medium.  (Ans. 6-7.)  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005719  Application 10/607,903    5Appellants argue that   In this case, there could be no predictable outcome since the evidence in the application clearly shows that success would have been possible in such a small number of cases, that absent screening for organisms with (1) secrete nuclease into the periplasmic space, (2) make very large amount of nuclease, and (3) which is not released until the organisms are lyzed, there was no possibility of success.  One cannot ignore the importance of the amount of nuclease expressed. The Board\\u2019s attention is drawn to the examples.  Even if one selected a Gram negative bacteria that made PHA, and engineered it to express nuclease, one would not know to select one expressing high amounts sufficient to degrade the nucleic acid in the culture medium.  (App. Br. 23.)  Appellants argue that, \\u201cHolmes steers one away from nucleases. Greer provides no disclosure that would steer one back to using nucleases, let alone recombinantly producing the nuclease as claimed.\\u201d  (Id. at 21.) Appellants further argue that, \\u201c[n]one of Liebl or Miller discloses engineering nuclease secretion into the periplasmic space.  Liebl and Miller disclose engineering the bacteria in those references to secrete nuclease into the cell culture medium.\\u201d  (Id. at 24.)  Appellants cite to the Declaration of Dr. Wolfgang Liebl, submitted October 13, 2009 as evidence that the nuclease of Liebl is secreted into the culture medium.  (Decl. 2.) In summary, Appellants argue that, \\u201c[t]he prior art in combination does not even vaguely guide one to recombinantly expressing nuclease in a Gram negative bacteria which is secreted into and stored in a high amount until the cells is lysed, to solve downstream processing problems.\\u201d  (App. Br. 29.) \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005719  Application 10/607,903    6The issue is:  Does the cited prior art support the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection?  PRINCIPLES OF LAW \\u201cIn rejecting claims under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103, the examiner bears the initial burden of presenting a prima facie case of obviousness.  Only if that burden is met, does the burden of coming forward with evidence or argument shift to the applicant.\\u201d  In re Rijckaert, 9 F.3d 1531, 1532 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (citations omitted).  In order to determine whether a prima facie case of obviousness has been established, we consider the factors set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17 (1966): (1) the scope and content of the prior art; (2) the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue; (3) the level of ordinary skill in the relevant art; and (4) objective evidence of nonobviousness, if present. \\u201cThe combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results.\\u201d KSR Int\\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 416 (2007). Where . . . the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, the PTO can require an applicant to prove that the prior art products do not necessarily or inherently possess the characteristics of his claimed product\\u2026.  Whether the rejection is based on \\u201cinherency\\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102, on \\u201cprima facie obviousness\\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103, jointly or alternatively, the burden of proof is the same, and its fairness is evidenced by the PTO\\u2019s inability to manufacture products or to obtain and compare prior art products.     In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255 (CCPA 1977) (emphasis added.) \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005719  Application 10/607,903    7ANALYSIS We have decided this case in conjunction with Appeal No. 2012-004554, Application No. 11/924350.  In addition, we have reviewed our Decisions in related Appeal Nos. 2002-001357, Application No. 09/281,363, and 2003-001996, Application No. 09/456,940.  We further acknowledge that the claims before us include modifications not present in our earlier Decisions. However, in the present case, for the most part, we agree with the Examiner\\u2019s fact finding, statement of the rejection and responses to Appellants\\u2019 arguments as set forth in the Answer.  We find that the Examiner has provided evidence to support a prima facie case of obviousness, except for the subject matter of claim 7.  We provide the following additional comment to reasoning set forth in the Answer.  Appellants argue that, \\u201cHolmes steers one away from nucleases\\u201d citing the expense of nucleases, and that \\u201cGreer provides no disclosure that would steer one back to using nucleases, let alone recombinantly producing the nuclease as claimed.\\u201d  (App. Br. 21.) We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s indicated motivation to combine Greer with Liebl, Miller, Atkinson and Lee, which is substantially the same issue addressed and decided in our earlier Decision Appeal No. 2003-001996, pages 11-12.  The fact that both Greer and Holmes found that the use of nucleases is expensive does not mean that the prior art was not aware of the viscosity problem associated with nucleic acids and fermentation product recover, or unaware that nucleases could be used in place of peroxide to address the viscosity problem.  The process made obvious by the cited references involves expressing a nuclease gene in recombinant cells, not \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005719  Application 10/607,903    8buying purified nucleases to add to the medium.  Appellants have not explained why the expense of commercially available nucleases would discourage a skilled artisan from practicing the method suggested by the prior art.  We are further unconvinced by Dr. Oliver P. Peoples Declaration, submitted February 8, 2011, which argues that the expense and use of nucleases is prohibitive (Decl. 2) for the reasons discussed above.   Appellants further argue that, \\u201c[n]one of Liebl or Miller discloses engineering nuclease secretion into the periplasmic space.  Liebl and Miller disclose engineering the bacteria in those references to secrete nuclease into the cell culture medium.\\u201d  (App. Br. 24.)  Appellants cite to the Declaration of Dr. Liebl as evidence that the nuclease of Liebl is secreted into the culture medium.  (Decl. 2.) We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s response to this argument set forth on pages 12-14 of the Answer, and find acceptable the Examiner\\u2019s use of Boynton to show that the R. eutropha cells taught by Lee inherently secrete nuclease into the periplasmic space.  The Declaration of Dr. Liebl does not address or rebut this finding. Appellants argue that   In this case, there could be no predictable outcome since the evidence in the application clearly shows that success would have been possible in such a small number of cases, that absent screening for organisms with (1) secrete nuclease into the periplasmic space, (2) make very large amount of nuclease, and (3) which is not released until the organisms are lyzed, there was no possibility of success.  One cannot ignore the importance of the amount of nuclease expressed.  (App. Br. 23.) \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005719  Application 10/607,903    9We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s response to the expectation of success and predictability arguments set forth on pages 10-12 of the Answer.  In particular, we agree with the Examiner that Appellants\\u2019 disclosure in the Specification that about 10% of their nuclease expressing clones expressed a high level of nuclease is not unpredictable in the screening art.  With respect to unpredictability in the screening art, it has been held that some experimentation, even a considerable amount, is not \\u201cundue\\u201d if, e.g., it is merely routine.  (compare, In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 737 (Fed. Cir. 1988)(addressing the predictability issue with respect to the enablement requirement)). With respect to the claimed level of nuclease production, secretion and degradation, we agree with the Examiner that, in Boynton,  PHA producing R. eutropha cells were generated using the same nuclease encoding gene taught by Leibl [sic] et al. above (See Boynton et al. Materials AND Methods, p 1524 and Figure 3, p 1527 and supporting text p 1526).  Boynton et al. teach that the transformant \\u201cR. eutropha secreted nuclease into the periplasm but not into the growth medium\\u201d (p1526, Construction of nuclease integrants of other PHA producers).  Thus the bacterial strain that is obvious over the above references inherently produces the nuclease such that it is secreted into the periplasmic space because they are gram negative bacteria.  Boynton et al. further characterize the nuclease activity of the periplasmic nuclease of the transformed R. eutropha cells in the data provided in Figure 3 and the supporting text, in which they show the result of chromosomal DNA treatment with periplasmic fractions of R. eutropha MBX917 (::nuckan) (lane 4) and R. eutropha NCIMB40124HD untransformed parent strain (lane 5) at 37\\xb0C for 1 hour.  As is evident from the results of Figure 3, after only one hour of incubation with the transformed R. eutropha periplasmic fraction, all of the visible high molecular weight DNA was digested to smaller molecular weight fragments.  Based upon this level of digestion of high molecular weight chromosomal DNA for only one hour at 37\\xb0C, \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005719  Application 10/607,903    10clearly the level of nuclease produced in the transformed R. eutropha strain would digest at least 95% of all nucleic acid released following lysis of the bacterial cells in a 24 hour period.  (Ans. 13-14.)  In other words, we find consistent with our earlier Decision in Appeal No. 2003-001996, page 13, that, \\u201c[u]nder these circumstances, it is incumbent upon appellants to establish through objective evidence that such levels of overexpression of nuclease [as in the cited references] do not necessarily provide the function set forth in claim 1 on appeal.\\u201d   Claim 7  Appellants provide separate argument for claim 7 on page 31 of the Brief.  Claim 7 requires a strain \\u201cgenetically modified to express a heterologous nuclease gene integrated into the chromosome of the bacterial host.\\u201d  Appellants argue that, \\u201c[a]s noted above, Miller and Liebl disclose plasmid expression.  No reason is provided for why one would go to the trouble of integrating the nuclease into the chromosome.\\u201d  (App. Br. 32.)  In response, the Examiner argues that It is routine knowledge in the art that nuclear material integrated into the host chromosome is more stable than that nuclear material which remains on an extra-chromosomal plasmid.  As all of these methods are routine in the art, it appears that the integration of the nuclease encoding gene into the host chromosome would be so as to increase the stability of the nuclease encoding material in the transformed host cell.  (Ans. 17-18.)  We are not persuaded by the Examiner\\u2019s argument.  The Examiner fails to support this rejection with evidence in the prior art to support his position that it is routine knowledge in the art that nuclear material \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-005719  Application 10/607,903    11integrated into the host chromosome is more stable than that nuclear material which remains on an extra-chromosomal plasmid.  Therefore, we are constrained to reverse the rejection of claim 7, as unsupported by evidence in the record. CONCLUSION OF LAW The cited references support the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection, except the rejection of claim 7 is reversed.   No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a).    AFFIRMED-IN-PART    cdc  \\x0c'},\n",

In response to the intercepted message, the VTL appliance sends a command to initiate the backing up of the data.  A network attached storage (NAS) server, which is the source of the data and is coupled to the VTL appliance by a network, receives the command.  An agent located in the NAS server is triggered in response to the command to directly transfer the data from the source to the destination.  The agent informs the VTL appliance upon completion of the transfer of the data. Spec., p. 13, Abstract. Independent claim 11 is illustrative, with emphasis on a key disputed limitation. 11.  A Virtual Tape Library (VTL) data archiving system, comprising: a VTL appliance, a data source server including a data source storage device, and a data destination storage device that are each coupled to each other through a network such that the data source storage device and the data destination storage device are coupled together through the network, wherein the data source storage device comprises a plurality of data; and an agent that is loaded on the data source server; wherein the VTL appliance is operable to intercept a backup message that include pointers to the data source server and the data destination storage device and send a command to the agent, and wherein in response to receiving the command, the agent transfers at least some of the plurality of data directly from the data source storage device to the data destination storage device over the network.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008317 Application 11/412,147   3The Examiner relies on the following reference as evidence of unpatentability: Kitamura U.S. 2008/0301363 A1 Dec. 4, 2008 REJECTION The Examiner rejected claims 11, 14-17, 20, and 21 under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 102(e) as anticipated by Kitamura.

Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the source file system (disk) 162 and virtual tape device (disk) 163 of the disks 16 in Kitamura are coupled together through a network via the disk I/F 15 and thus the data is able to be transferred directly between them over a network (i.e. a LAN, SCSI or FC network, etc.), as recited by independent claims 11 and 17.  . . . .   . . . Kitamura further teaches [Figs. 1-2, 4 & 12, steps 2004-2005] that in response to receiving the instruction, the backup service 69 instructs the disk system 1 to execute a copy processing for transferring the data stored on the backup source disk [162] to the backup destination disk [163] [see para. 0111-0112]. As described above, since disks 161-164 are connected to the network via the disk I/F 15, the data transferred between the storage devices 162 and 163 clearly occurs over the network.  (Examiner\\u2019s Note: It will be obvious to one skilled in the art to recognize that the storage device system 0 itself, or even the entire computer system, of Figs. 1 [and] 2 can be considered as a network in a broader sense.) Id. at p. 9-12.  The Examiner presents this application of Kitamura in rejecting all claims.  Id. at p. 4-11.  Appellants argue: [T]he claims recite that an agent transfers at least some of the plurality of data directly from the data source storage device to the data destination storage device over the network[.] . . . [T]he data transferred between [Kitamura\\u2019s] storage devices 162 and 163 does not occur over a network between the front end server 6 and the disk system 1, but rather occurs all within the disk system 1.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008317 Application 11/412,147   6App. Br., p. 6.  In response to the Examiner\\u2019s above explanation of the rejection (supra, p. 4-5), Appellants similarly argue:  [T]he disk system 1 of Kitamura connects to the network in through the LAN I/F 11 and the FC I/F 12 (i.e., to coupled to the Front End Server 6)[.] . . . [A]ctions performed within the disk system 1 of Kitamura do not occur \\u201cover\\u201d or \\u201cthrough\\u201d a network.   Reply Br., p. 4.   Appellants\\u2019 arguments fail to address Kitamura\\u2019s cited disk I/F 15; e.g., fail to address whether the cited backup data traverses the disk I/F 15 and/or whether the disk I/F 15 is part of a network.  However, we agree with Appellants\\u2019 arguments insofar as the Examiner has not articulated how Kitamura teaches the cited backup data as traversing the disk I/F 15 when copied from the backup source disk 162 to the backup destination disk 163 (as required to support the Examiner\\u2019s application of Kitamura).  The Examiner merely states that all communication interfaces and connections of the disk system 1 are part of a network and, further, that all communications of the disk system 1 \\u201cclearly\\u201d and/or \\u201cobvious[ly]\\u201d traverse the disk I/F 15 and thus occur over the network.  Ans., p. 10-12.  This finding impermissibly speculates as to the path of the cited backup data\\u2019s transfer from the backup source disk 162 to the backup destination disk 163 and, particularly, speculates that the backup data traverses the disk I/F 15.  That is not to say such a path is neither implicit nor obvious, especially considering that \\u201cthe memory 14 [of the disk system 1] serves as a cache memory for temporarily storing write data[.]\\u201d  Kitamura, \\xb6 [0038].  However, the Examiner has not specified a teaching of transferring the cited backup data via the disk I/F 15.  Likewise, even assuming arguendo that the present rejection were issued under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103, the Examiner has not \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008317 Application 11/412,147   7articulated a rationale for transferring the cited backup data via the disk I/F 15. For the foregoing reasons, we do not sustain the anticipation rejection of claims 11, 14-17, 20, and 21 over Kitamura.   ORDER The Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting claims 11, 14-17, 20, and 21 is reversed. REVERSED     llw \\x0c'},\n",

ENG __________   Appeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828 Technology Center 1700 ___________   Before ADRIENE LEPIANE HANLON, GEORGE C. BEST, and  DONNA M. PRAISS, Administrative Patent Judges.  HANLON, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828   2  A. STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Appellant has filed an appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 from an Examiner\\u2019s decision finally rejecting claims 1-12 and 23-42.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We REVERSE and enter new grounds of rejection. The subject matter on appeal is directed to a process for producing olefins from hydrocarbon mixtures containing one or more butanes comprising, inter alia, the step of bypassing a first product around an existing etherification reactor for converting isobutylene to methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). According to the Appellant\\u2019s Specification: MTBE production has decreased as various jurisdictions restricted or banned its use.  By late 2006 most American gasoline retailers stopped using MTBE as an oxygenate.  Accordingly, domestic production has continued to decline.  As a result, MTBE manufacturers are left holding useless feedstocks and manufacturing assets.  There is a need, therefore, for reallocating feedstocks and manufacturing assets previously allocated to the manufacture of MTBE, thereby providing an economic benefit to MTBE manufacturers.   Spec., \\xb6\\xb6 [0003]-[0004]. The Appellant\\u2019s process reallocates MTBE feedstocks and manufacturing assets to produce olefins such as propylene.  Spec., \\xb6 [0012].   Representative claim 1 is reproduced below from the Claims Appendix of the Appeal Brief dated January 17, 2012 (\\u201cApp. Br.\\u201d).   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828   3  1. A process for producing one or more olefins, comprising:  [1] dehydrogenating a feed comprising one or more C4-containing compounds to provide a first product comprising about 20 vol% to about 80 vol% isobutylene;  [2] bypassing the first product comprising about 20 vol% to about 80 vol% isobutylene around an existing etherification reactor for converting isobutylene to methyl tert-butyl ether; and   [3] cracking at least a portion of the first product comprising about 20 vol% to about 80 vol% isobutylene to provide a second product comprising propylene, ethylene, and butane. Claims 1-12 and 23-42 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Hensley (U.S. 5,254,748 issued Oct. 19, 1993) in view of Vora (U.S. 6,049,017 issued Apr. 11, 2000) and Tsunoda (U.S. 6,307,117 B1 issued Oct. 23, 2001).  The Appellant presents separate arguments for claims 1, 2, 5, 32, 33, and 38 in the Appeal Brief.   B. EXAMINER\\u2019S REJECTION UNDER 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) The Examiner finds Hensley discloses a process for producing isoolefins comprising, inter alia, dehydrogenating a feed comprising one or more C4-containing compounds to provide a first product which bypasses a MTBE reactor.  Ans. 4-5.1  The Examiner relies on Tsunoda and Vora as teaching the production of ethylene, propylene, and butane in an olefin cracking process.  Id. at 5.  The Examiner concludes it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to introduce an olefin cracking step in Hensley to produce ethylene and propylene \\u201c[s]ince ethylene and propylene are important raw materials for a variety of products.\\u201d  Id. at 5-6.                                                    1 Examiner\\u2019s Answer dated February 24, 2012. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828   4  Contrary to the Examiner\\u2019s findings, Hensley does not disclose that the first product bypasses a MTBE reactor.  Rather, Hensley discloses that \\u201c[a]n essential feature of all the disclosed embodiments of the present invention is directed to integrating a combination hydrogenation/dehydrogenation step . . . into an etherification process.\\u201d  Hensley, col. 3, ll. 24-28; see also App. Br. 10.  Thus, absent the Appellant\\u2019s disclosure, there would have been no reason to bypass the first product around a MTBE reactor in Hensley\\u2019s process and introduce an olefin cracking step as proposed by the Examiner.2  For this reason, the \\xa7 103(a) rejection is not sustained.   C. NEW GROUNDS OF REJECTION Claims 1-12, 23-37, and 39-42 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Tsunoda, Hensley,  and paragraphs [0003] and [0004] of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification.  1. Claim 1 There is no dispute on this record that Tsunoda discloses a method of producing ethylene, propylene, and butane by cracking C4+ olefins.  Ans. 5; see also Tsunoda, col. 12, ll. 14-15 (ethylene and propylene are collected from the obtained H2-C3 fraction); Tsunoda, col. 12, ll. 38-48 (butane is separated by the C4 separator).  In one embodiment, Tsunoda discloses that the hydrocarbon feedstock is a C4 fraction comprised mainly of C4 hydrocarbons, such as butane, isobutane,                                                  2 The Examiner also concludes that it would have been obvious \\u201cto modify Vora invention and take the C4+ stream directly to the cracking step as disclosed by Tsunoda when MTBE is not a required product.\\u201d  Ans. 6.  To the extent that the Examiner is proposing that the claims on appeal are also unpatentable under \\xa7 103(a) based on Vora in view of Tsunoda, the Examiner has failed to demonstrate that the dehydrogenating step recited in claim 1 is rendered obvious by the combination of Vora and Tsunoda.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828   5  butene, and isobutene.  Tsunoda, col. 11, ll. 61-67.  Thus, we find Tsunoda discloses step [3] of the claimed process.   As for step [1] of the claimed process, Hensley discloses a method of producing tertiary alkyl ether compounds, such as MTBE, from a mixture of C4 hydrocarbons.  Hensley, col. 4, ll. 51-55.  According to one embodiment of the invention, a mixed C4 hydrocarbon feed stream is provided to a hydrogenation/dehydrogenation unit along with an isobutane stream from an isomerization unit.  Id. at col. 5, ll. 56-62.  Hensley discloses that the reaction product from the hydrogenation/de-hydrogenation unit comprises primarily isobutene but also contains significant amounts of butene-1, butene-2, n-butane, and isobutane.  Id. at col. 4, l. 67-col. 5, l. 2 and col. 5, ll. 52-54.   The reaction product from the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation unit of Hensley is substantially the same as the hydrocarbon feedstock used in the method of Tsunoda.  Thus, we find one of ordinary skill in the art would have considered Hensley\\u2019s reaction product to be a suitable feedstock in Tsunoda\\u2019s method.   As for step [2] of the claimed process, Hensley discloses that the reaction product from the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation unit feeds a distillation column, and the overhead from the distillation unit is fed to a MTBE unit.  Id. at col. 5, l. 63-col. 6, l. 2.   The Appellant discloses that MTBE production was on the decline at the time of the Appellant\\u2019s invention and \\u201cMTBE manufacturers are left holding useless feedstocks and manufacturing assets.\\u201d  Spec., \\xb6 [0003].  Thus, according to the Appellant, \\u201c[t]here is a need . . . for reallocating feedstocks and manufacturing assets previously allocated to the manufacture of MTBE, thereby providing an economic benefit to MTBE manufacturers.\\u201d  Id. at \\xb6 [0004].   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828   6   Based on this disclosure in the Appellant\\u2019s Specification, we find one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to reallocate Hensley\\u2019s MTBE feedstocks and manufacturing assets (i.e., Hensley\\u2019s hydrogenation/de-hydrogenation unit) to produce the feedstock in Tsunoda\\u2019s method.  This combination results in step [2] of the claimed process (i.e., bypassing Hensley\\u2019s reaction product from the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation unit around an existing etherification reactor).  Thus, we conclude the process recited in claim 1 is rendered obvious by the combination of Tsunoda, Hensley, and paragraphs [0003] and [0004] of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification.   2. Claim 2  Claim 2 depends from claim 1 and recites the following additional steps:    selectively separating at least a portion of the second product to provide a third product comprising propylene and a first recycle comprising butane; and  recycling at least a portion of the first recycle to the first product prior to cracking the first product. App. Br., Claims App\\u2019x.  The product obtained by cracking in Tsunoda\\u2019s method (i.e., second product) contains propylene, ethylene, and butane.  Tsunoda discloses that the second product is selectively separated to provide a third product comprising propylene and a first recycle comprising butane.  Tsunoda discloses that at least a portion of the first recycle is returned to the reactor and used as part of the hydrocarbon feedstock in the cracking operation.  Tsunoda, col. 12, ll. 1-22, 32-48.  Thus, Tsunoda discloses the process steps recited in claim 2.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828   7    3. Claim 5  Claim 5 depends from claim 1 and recites that \\u201cthe first product is heated to a temperature from 90\\xbaC to 370\\xbaC prior to cracking the first product.\\u201d  App. Br., Claims App\\u2019x.  Hensley discloses that the reaction temperature in the hydrogenation/de-hydrogenation unit is in the range of from about 600\\xba F. to about 1100\\xba F (i.e., from about 315\\xba C. to about 593\\xba C.).  Hensley, col. 4, ll. 31-37.  Thus, prior to cracking, the modified Tsunoda process heats the first product to a temperature that overlaps the claimed range. It is well-settled that \\u201ceven a slight overlap in range establishes a prima facie case of obviousness.\\u201d  In re Peterson, 315 F.3d 1325, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  Thus, the burden shifts to the Appellant to \\u201cshow that the [claimed] range is critical, generally by showing that the claimed range achieves unexpected results relative to the prior art range.\\u201d  In re Woodruff, 919 F.2d 1575, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990).  The Appellant has not provided such a showing on this record.    4. Claims 32 and 33  The Appellant argues Hensley does not \\u201cteach, show, or suggest the feed comprises about 70% vol or more isobutane (claim 32) or about 70% vol or more isobutane and about 5% vol to about 30% vol n-butane [(claim 33)].\\u201d  App. Br. 12.  Referring to the feeds in Hensley\\u2019s Examples 1 and 2, the Appellant argues the \\u201cisobutane and n-butane concentrations are far below the claimed ranges.\\u201d  Id; see also Hensley, col. 8, ll. 50-60 (feed contains 1.56% by weight n-butane); Hensley, col. 9, ll. 41-51 (feed contains 2.00% by weight n-butane).  However, \\u201cit is well established that the disclosure of a reference is not limited to specific \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828   8  working examples contained therein.\\u201d  In re Fracalossi, 681 F.2d 792, 794 n.1 (CCPA 1982).       We find Hensley teaches the concentration of isobutane in the feed stream is a result effective variable.  Hensley, col. 4, ll. 51-59; see also In re Boesch, 617 F.2d 272, 276 (CCPA 1980) (\\u201cdiscovery of an optimum value of a result effective variable in a known process is ordinarily within the skill of the art\\u201d).  Thus, the burden shifts to the Appellant to demonstrate that a feed comprising \\u201cabout 70% vol or more isobutane\\u201d achieves unexpectedly good results.  See In re Antonie, 559 F.2d 618, 620 (CCPA 1977) (a prima facie case of obviousness may be rebutted \\u201cwhere the results of optimizing a variable, which was known to be result effective, [are] unexpectedly good\\u201d).  The Appellant has not made such a showing on this record.   As for the concentration of n-butane recited in claim 33, we find the feeds employed by the Appellant and Hensley are both used for manufacturing MTBE.  Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the feeds would have similar n-butane concentrations.  In this regard, we note the Appellant does not disclose that the n-butane concentration is critical and indicates that as little as about 1% vol butane may be contained in the feedstock.  Spec., \\xb6 [0019]. Based on the foregoing, the weight of the evidence supports a conclusion of obviousness under \\xa7 103(a).  Claim 38 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable  over the combination of Tsunoda, Hensley, paragraphs [0003]  and [0004] of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification, and Vora.  As in claim 33, claim 38 recites \\u201cthe feed contains about 70% vol or more isobutane and about 5% vol to about 30% butane.\\u201d  However, claim 38 includes \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828   9  the additional limitation that \\u201cthe first recycle comprises about 5% vol to about 20% vol isobutane and about 20% vol to about 80% vol butane.\\u201d  App. Br., Claims App\\u2019x.  The Examiner relies on Vora as evidence that the claimed concentration of isobutane and butane in the first recycle would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  Ans. 10.  However, the Appellant argues \\u201cVora simply makes no mention or suggestion as to the claimed composition.\\u201d  App. Br. 13. The Examiner recognizes that Vora does not expressly disclose the claimed concentration of isobutane and butane in the first recycle.  Ans. 10.  However, Vora, like Tsunoda, employs a cracking reaction zone to produce ethylene and propylene.  See, e.g., Vora, col. 4, ll. 40-47.  The Examiner finds Vora discloses that preventing buildup of paraffins, such as isobutane, in the feed to the cracking reaction zone is necessary. Ans. 10; Vora, col. 9, ll. 54-55.  Thus, the Examiner concludes it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to \\u201cuse a recycle with the percentage of butane and isobutane in an appropriate rage [sic, range], including as claimed to prevent buildup of isobutene [sic, isobutane].\\u201d  Ans. 10.  The Appellant has not directed us to any error in the Examiner\\u2019s position. Moreover, Tsunoda discloses:  In the recycle system, butane contained in the hydrocarbon feedstock is concentrated in the C4 fraction separated by means of the above-mentioned C4 separator.  For this reason, if all of the C4 fraction is recycled to the reactor, the butane concentration of the hydrocarbon feedstock charged into the reactor would become high, so that the concentration of at least one olefin having 4 to 12 carbons in the hydrocarbon feedstock may become unsatisfactory.  Therefore, it is preferred that only a part of the C4 fraction is recycled to the   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828   10  reactor so as to suppress the increase in the butane concentration of the feedstock. Tsunoda, col. 12, ll. 38-48. Based on the foregoing, we find Vora and Tsunoda teach that the concentrations of isobutane and butane in the first recycle are result-effective variables.  See Boesch, 617 F.2d at 276 (\\u201cdiscovery of an optimum value of a result effective variable in a known process is ordinarily within the skill of the art\\u201d).  The Appellant has not directed us to any evidence demonstrating that a first recycle comprising the claimed concentrations of isobutane and butane achieves unexpectedly good results.  See Antonie, 559 F.2d at 620 (a prima facie case of obviousness may be rebutted \\u201cwhere the results of optimizing a variable, which was known to be result effective, [are] unexpectedly good\\u201d).  Thus, the weight of the evidence supports a conclusion of obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a).   D. DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 1-12 and 23-42 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Hensley in view of Vora and Tsunoda is reversed.   Claims 1-12, 23-37, and 39-42 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Tsunoda, Hensley, and paragraphs [0003] and [0004] of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification.   Claim 38 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Tsunoda, Hensley, paragraphs [0003] and [0004] of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification, and Vora. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007957 Application 11/927,828   11  This decision contains new grounds of rejection under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.50(b) which provides that \\u201c[a] new ground of rejection . . . shall not be considered final for judicial review.\\u201d 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.50(b) also provides that the Appellant, WITHIN TWO MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THE DECISION, must exercise one of the following two options with respect to the new grounds of rejection to avoid termination of the appeal as to the rejected claims:  (1) Reopen prosecution.  Submit an appropriate amendment of the claims so rejected or new evidence relating to the claims so rejected, or both, and have the matter reconsidered by the examiner, in which event the proceeding will be remanded to the examiner.  . . . (2) Request rehearing.  Request that the proceeding be reheard under  \\xa7 41.52 by the Board upon the same record.  . . . No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a).  REVERSED (37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.50(b))  bar \\x0c'},\n",

(Id. (quoting Chen 1 Abstract).)  The Examiner also finds one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to include a wetting step in the combined Taboas/Chen 1 method based on Chen 2\\u2019s disclosure that dripping some polymer solvent onto a wax mold before casting provides more efficient casting.  (Id. at 6.)  Appellants do not dispute the Examiner\\u2019s findings with respect to the teachings of the individual references.  (See generally App. Br. 9-12.)  Rather, Appellants argue the ordinary artisan at the time of the invention would not have found the nano-fibrous walls formed by the claimed method an easily predictable and achievable combination of the prior art.  (Id. at 9.)  Appellants direct us to the Specification6 and Exhibits A-C (App. Br., Evidence App\\u2019x)7 in support of their contention that \\u201c[t]he formation of the nano-fibrous walls described in independent claim 21 is the result of the selection of at least a particular mold material, a particular polymer and/or polymer concentration, a particular solvent mixture at a                                            6 (id. at 10 (citing Spec. 13:27-30, 16:22-25, and Figs. 1D, 1E, 3B, and 3D)). 7 (id. at 10-11 (citing Guobao Wei & Peter X.

We agree with the Examiner that a preponderance of the evidence, taking into account the evidence in the Specification and Exhibits A-C, still weighs in favor of obviousness.  Cf. Sud-Chemie, Inc. v. Multisorb Techs., Inc., 554 F.3d 1001, 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\\u201c[E]vidence of unexpected results and other secondary considerations will not necessarily overcome a strong prima facie showing of obviousness\\u201d).  Even assuming the Specification and Exhibits A-C support Appellants\\u2019 contention that nano-fibrous walls cannot be achieved absent selection of the polymer, solvent, and mold material recited in claim 21, the evidence of record supports the Examiner\\u2019s finding that Chen 1 explicitly discloses a conventional casting technique as claimed (see Chen 1, page 2069 (\\u201c[O]ther solvent systems could be used to create porous nano-fibrous scaffolds.  One such system was PLLA dissolved in a solution of 4:1 (v/v) dioxane/methanol.\\u201d); see also, id. at page 2066), and Taboas discloses such conventional casting technique may be used to create micro-porosity in a PLLA polymer using a wax mold (see Taboas \\xb6 [0068]).  While Chen 1 carries out the phase-separation at -18 \\xbaC rather than -20 \\xbaC as claimed, the relevant case law supports a prima facie case of obviousness and a shifting of the burden to Appellants to show criticality in the claimed temperature.  See In re Aller, 220 F.2d 454, 456 (CCPA 1955) (explaining it is normally expected that a change in temperature, or concentration, or both, would be an unpatentable modification over the prior art and, therefore, when patentability is predicated upon a change in a condition of a prior art composition, such as a change in concentration or the like, the burden is on Appellant to establish with objective evidence that the change is critical, i.e. it leads to a new unexpected result); see also In re Woodruff, 919 F.2d 1575, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007511 Application 11/496,238   6Appellants have not met this burden.  (Compare App. Br. 10 (arguing \\u201cExhibit B illustrate[s] that temperature affects the formation of nano-fibers\\u201d) with Ans. 9 (discussing Appellants\\u2019 Exhibit B).)  Likewise, Appellants have not met their burden to show criticality in the \\u201c9% (wt/v)\\u201d limitation recited in claim 31.  (Compare App. Br. 12 with Ans. 10-11.) We are further in agreement with the Examiner that Appellants improperly rely on unclaimed features in support of patentability, e.g., the order of the method steps (see App. Br. 9 supra pp. 4-5; id. at 10 (discussing Exhibit B)), see Interactive Gift Express, Inc. v. Compuserve Inc., 256 F.3d 1323, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (\\u201c[T]here is no reason why step one[ ] . . . must occur before step four[ ] . . . .\\u201d); see also Respironics, Inc. v. Invacare Corp., 303 Fed. Appx. 865, 870 (Fed.

In sum, for the reasons stated in the Answer and above, Appellants have not persuaded us of error in the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion of obviousness.  Therefore, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s decision to reject claims 7, 21, 25, 27, 31, and 32.

SCHEINER, Administrative Patent Judge.  DECISION ON APPEAL This is an appeal1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 from the final rejection of claims 1-23, directed to printing system, printer driver, and method of processing a print job.  The claims have been rejected on the grounds of anticipation and obviousness.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b). We affirm-in-part.                                            1  Appellants identify the Real Party-In-Interest as Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP (App. Br. 2).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE  The Specification teaches that \\u201cmost printing systems process a print job with a printer driver on a host computer that converts a file, representing the image to be printed, into a PDL [page description language] format for transmission to a printer\\u201d (Spec. \\xb6 11).  \\u201cThe printer then completes the rendering of the print job including rasterizing the image data before printing the desired hardcopy document\\u201d (id.). Nevertheless, according to the Specification, \\u201cit is possible for more or all of the rendering of the print job to be performed on the host computer rather than by the printer\\u201d (id. at \\xb612).  \\u201c[I]n some cases, due to the nature of the print job, the rendering process is more efficient if performed on the host computer rather than by the printer. . . .  Sometimes the rendering is most efficiently performed by the dedicated hardware and firmware of the printer\\u201d (id.). The present specification describes methods and systems that dynamically optimize printing by analyzing the printing system configuration and print job attributes to determine where rendering can be performed most efficiently and then performing the rendering of the image data at that optimal location or with that optimal part of the printing system.  (Id. at \\xb6 15.) Claims 1-23 are pending and on appeal.  Representative claims 1, 3, 5, and 8 are reproduced below: 1. A printing system for processing a print job comprising; a host computer; and a printer in communication with said host computer; wherein said host computer comprises a printer driver that determines whether each print job unit can be more efficiently rendered on said host computer or on said printer and processes said print job accordingly.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  3  3. The system of claim 1, wherein said printer driver determines whether each print job unit can be more rapidly rendered on said host computer or on said printer. 5. The system of claim 1, wherein said printer driver determines whether said print job unit is more efficiently rendered on said host computer or on said printer based on at least one of (1) printer hardware configuration; (2) host computer hardware configuration; (3) a current application on said host computer; (4) content of the print job unit; (5) any applicable user input; (6) connection bandwidth between the host computer and printer; (7) whether the host computer and printer are connected directly or by a network and whether any part of the connection is wireless; and (8) whether the printer is shared by other host computers or is dedicated to said host. 8. A method of processing a print job comprising determining whether each step in rendering a print job unit of said print job can be more rapidly completed on a host computer or on a printer, and rendering said print job accordingly.

Claims 14 and 20 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Lee and Brown (Ans. 13-14). FINDINGS OF FACT The following findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of the evidence of record. 1. According to the Specification,  [T]he process of \\u201crendering\\u201d a print job comprises the various language or format conversions that are performed on a print job data set before that data is ready for use by the print engine and print engine controller that will produce the desired hardcopy document.  Consequently, \\u201crendering\\u201d includes converting an application file or other data into a PDL-formatted print job; converting the PDL data through any number of additional intermediate language or format conversions, for example a display list; and rasterizing the print job data. (Spec. \\xb6 10.) 2. The Specification discloses a hybrid printer driver: [T]he hybrid printer driver (114) receives data representing the document to be printed, whether from an application file or other source.  However, rather than simply converting the data into a PDL format, the hybrid printer driver (114) will execute an imaging algorithm (115).  This imaging algorithm (115) will make a determination . . . whether the print job, or a portion thereof, is most efficiently rendered by the host (112) rather than the printer (110). (Spec. \\xb6 34.) \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  5  The hybrid printer driver (114) also includes a rendering function (116) that can be invoked to render parts or all of a print job if the host computer (112) can do so more efficiently than can the printer (110).  The rendering function (116) can be programmed to handle different portions of the print job rendering process as best suits a particular application.  For example, the rendering function (116) may be capable of rasterizing a print job, including converting the print job from a PDL format through any intermediate steps to a rasterized data set, for use directly by the print engine controller (104) of the printer (110).  In other examples, the rendering function (116) may perform only one or some of the rendering steps traditionally performed by the printer (110), such as converting a PDL format print job into a display list, leaving rasterization to occur in the printer (110). (Spec. \\xb636.) 3. In addition, the Specification discloses: [F]or any given print job, a page of a print job or a strip of a print job page, it may be more efficient to render the data with either the host computer\\u2019s resources or the printer's resources.  Efficient in this context refers to rendering time, i.e., will the host computer\\u2019s resources or the printer\\u2019s resources be able to render the data in less time.  Rendering time will be effected by two things: (1) processor operations (e.g. processor speed, memory access, calculations, data manipulation, etc.) and (2) memory availability, e.g., Random Access Memory (RAM). When memory is scarce, the rendering time of the page will be significantly increased. . . . The host typically has more powerful processors and almost always has orders of magnitude more memory.  Consequently, the host may frequently be the more efficient system for rendering.  However, this is not always so.  Consequently, when a print job is to be printed (determination 200), the rendering of that print job can be optimized by the job, by the page or by the strip by determining whether the host or the printer can render that job, page or strip more efficiently, i.e., more rapidly. (Spec. \\xb6 39 (emphasis added).) \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  6  4. The Specification further discloses that: [P]rinting systems can experience significant performance degradation if an application utilizes unsupported or complex graphic primitives. . . .  Other performance issues arise because of the memory requirements of the print job and/or the available memory on the printing device.  Low memory conditions on the printing device can slow a print job significantly, so the Hybrid driver will analyze the memory requirements of the job and the [memory] available on the device and make rendering decisions based upon this analysis.  Other applications simply generate poorly constructed graphics which result in inefficient rendering at the printer when the print job is transmitted.  This situation has arisen, for example, with applications written for one platform that are then ported to another platform without full consideration of printing performance.  Therefore, the resulting print job for a file originating with the ported application does not print efficiently.  However, even some applications running on the platform for which they were written may still generate poorly constructed graphics that are difficult for a printer to render. (Spec. \\xb6\\xb6 13, 14 (emphasis added).)  5. According to the Specification: As used herein and in the appended claims, the term \\u201cprint job unit\\u201d will be used to refer generically to a print job or a portion of a print job for which a determination is made whether rendering is more efficient on the host computer or the associated printer.  As such, \\u201cprint job unit\\u201d may refer to an entire print job, a page of a print job, a strip of a print job or other portion of a print job. (Spec. \\xb6 40.)  6. Lee teaches that the time for transmitting data code from a host computer to a printer \\u201cwill increase so much as the excessive quantity of the data code\\u201d (Lee, col. 5, ll. 6-8), and discloses a method of processing a print job which avoids \\u201cthe problems of increasing the manufacturing cost and the \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  7  data transmission time\\u201d when the amount of data code for the print job exceeds the memory storage capacity of the printer (id. at col. 5, ll. 9-11).  7. Lee\\u2019s method comprises [C]onverting printing data in a printer driver by converting printing data into a data code and comparing a quantity of the data code with the storage capacity of a memory prepared in a printer.  If the quantity of the data code exceeds the storage capacity of the memory, then the data code is converted into bit map data that can be processed at a print engine of the printer.  If the quantity of the data code does not exceed the storage capacity of the memory, then the data code is transmitted to the printer.  If the quantity of the data code exceeds the storage capacity of the memory, then the bit map data is transmitted to the printer.  (Lee, col. 2, ll. 45-55.)  8. Ferlitsch discloses a system for sharing rasterization tasks among several print system devices: The rasterization load can be balanced between the client and printer by, e.g., having the client rasterize every other page in the print job and send the print job to the printer in a mixed format, with some pages in raster format and some pages in PDL format.  The printer rasterizes the remaining pages as it receives them in the print job, and thus the rasterization load is halved on both devices.  The client and the printer rasterize the print job in what can be viewed as a serial or pipeline approach, where each touches a part of the print job as it passes through.  Once the \\u201cpipeline\\u201d is filled, the efficiency of this approach is in all likelihood much better than the efficiency of a parallel scatter-gather approach, and requires fewer processing and storage resources to accomplish. (Ferlitsch \\xb6 5.)  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  8  ANTICIPATION I. Claim 1 The Examiner finds that Lee discloses a system for processing a print job comprising, in relevant part, a host computer, a printer driver on the host computer, and a printer (Ans. 3).  The Examiner finds that Lee\\u2019s printer driver determines whether the printer has sufficient memory for the data code for a given print job; if so, the data code is transmitted to the printer for rendering, if not, the data code is converted to a bitmap (i.e., rendered) by the host computer, and the bitmap is transmitted to the printer instead (id. at 4).  The Examiner further finds that \\u201cthe reason . . . is to decrease the cost and data transmission time requirements, where the data transmission time requirement at least affects the efficiency of rendering of print data\\u201d (id.). Appellants contend that claim 1, which recites determining \\u201cwhether each print job unit can be more efficiently rendered\\u201d on a host computer or on a printer, \\u201cmust be understood as reciting a printing system in which a printer driver determines whether each portion of a print job can be rendered more quickly by the host computer or the printer and then processes the print job accordingly\\u201d (App. Br. 9-10).   Appellants contend that: Rather than assessing efficiency, i.e., will the host computer\\u2019s resources or the printer\\u2019s resources be able to render the data in less time . . . .  Lee merely teaches comparing total printer memory size to the quantity of data code in the print job. Rendering is thus driven, not by a consideration of efficiency or where the data can be rendered more quickly, but merely by whether the print job exceeds the size of the printer\\u2019s memory. There may well be cases where, even if the print job exceeds the size of the printer\\u2019s memory, the printer may still be the \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  9  faster and more efficient device for rendering the print job in blocks matching the size of the printer's memory. (App. Br. 10.) We agree with Appellants that interpreting the claim language \\u201cmore efficiently\\u201d as encompassing \\u201cmore quickly\\u201d is consistent with the way the term \\u201cefficiently\\u201d is used in the Specification (see FFs 3, 4), although we note that the term is broader, as it also encompasses, e.g., elements of print quality (see FF4).  Additionally, we note that claim 1 requires determining whether \\u201ceach print job unit\\u201d (rather than \\u201ceach portion of a print job\\u201d) can be more efficiently rendered on the host computer or the printer.  Inasmuch as a \\u201cprint job unit\\u201d can be the entire print job (FF5), we do not agree that the claim requires making a determination for \\u201ceach portion of a print job.\\u201d (App. Br. 9.) In any case, we do not agree that interpreting \\u201cmore efficiently\\u201d as encompassing \\u201cmore quickly\\u201d distinguishes the printing system of claim 1 from Lee\\u2019s printing system.  Lee teaches that the purpose of determining the printer\\u2019s memory capacity and rendering a print job on the host computer or the printer accordingly, is to decrease transmission time and cost (FF6).  Even accepting for the sake of argument that there may be instances where memory capacity is not the only factor affecting printing time, Appellants\\u2019 Specification teaches that memory availability is a principle factor in printing speed (\\u201cWhen memory is scarce, the rendering time of the page will be significantly increased.\\u201d  (Spec. \\xb6 39; FF3).)  Moreover, as discussed above, we do not agree with Appellants that speed is the only attribute of efficiency as that term is used in the Specification. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  10  Accordingly, the rejection of claim 1 as anticipated by Lee is affirmed, as is the rejection of claim 4, which was not separately argued (see 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37 (c)(1)(vii)).   Claims 5 and 13  We agree with Appellants that the Examiner has not established that Lee\\u2019s printer driver makes any determinations \\u201cbased on any of the criteria listed\\u201d (App. Br. 15) in claims 5 and 13.  Accordingly, the rejection of claims 5 and 13 as anticipated by Lee is reversed. Claims 8 and 17  Claims 8 and 17 require determining whether \\u201ceach step in rendering a print job unit\\u201d of a print job can be more rapidly completed on a host computer or on a printer.  The Examiner has rejected claims 8 and 17 \\u201cfor reasons similar to Claim[] 1\\u201d (Ans. 4), and further finds that Lee, in the Abstract, \\u201cdiscloses that rendering comprises converting printing code to data code, i.e., a single step\\u201d (id. at 21). Appellants contend that Lee \\u201cdoes not teach or suggest that, for \\u2018each step in rendering a print job\\u2019 (claim 8), a determination is made as to where that rendering step is to be performed.  Rather, Lee only teaches one comparison of whether a quantity of data code with the storage capacity of the printer memory\\u201d (App. Br. 12).  Similarly, Appellants contend that Lee \\u201cdoes not teach or suggest a printer driver that, for \\u2018each step in rendering a print job unit\\u2019 (claim 17), makes a determination is made [sic] as to where that rendering step is to be performed\\u201d (id. at 13).  Appellants have the better position here.  Lee discloses at least two steps in rendering a print job: (1) converting printing data into a data code, \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  11  and (2) converting data code into bitmap data (FF7).  Whether the conversion of data code into bitmap code occurs on the host computer or the printer, it is still a step in rendering the print job.  Accordingly, the rejection of claims 8 and 17 as anticipated by Lee is reversed, as is the rejection of claims 9, 10, and 19, which depend from claims 8 and 17. OBVIOUSNESS II.  Claim 3 stands rejected as unpatentable over Lee and the AAPA.  Claim 3 depends from claim 1, and requires determining whether \\u201ceach print job unit can be more rapidly rendered\\u201d on a host computer or a printer.  Appellants contend that \\u201cLee merely teaches determining whether an entire print job exceeds the size of a printer\\u2019s memory\\u201d (App. Br. 15), and \\u201cthere is no teaching or suggestion in Lee of dividing a print job into smaller units and then determining whether each such unit can be more rapidly rendered on a host computer or printer\\u201d (id.). Nevertheless, as discussed above, Lee is directed to reducing the transmission time of a print job.  Moreover, a \\u201cprint job unit\\u201d can be the entire print job (FF5).  Therefore, we do not agree that claim 3 requires dividing a print job into smaller units and then determining whether each such unit can be more rapidly rendered on a host computer or printer. The rejection of claim 3 as unpatentable over Lee and AAPA is affirmed.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  12  III.  Claims 2, 7, 12, 18, and 23 stand rejected as unpatentable over Lee and Ferlitsch.  Claim 2 depends from claim 1 and requires determining whether a fraction of an entire print job can be rendered more efficiently on a host computer or a printer.  The Examiner acknowledges that Lee does not disclose this limitation.  Claim 12 depends from claim 8, which requires determining whether each step in rendering a print job unit can be more rapidly completed on a host computer or on a printer.  Claim 18 depends from claim 17, and also requires determining whether \\u201ceach step in rendering a print job unit\\u201d of a print job can be more rapidly completed on a host computer or on a printer.  Claim 23 is an independent claim that also requires determining whether \\u201ceach step in rendering a print job unit\\u201d of a print job can be more rapidly completed on a host computer or on a printer.  As discussed above, Lee does not disclose this limitation.   For all of these claims, the Examiner turns to Ferlitsch as disclosing a \\u201cload balancing technique\\u201d where the host computer and the printer split the task of rendering a print job, and concludes that it would have been obvious for one of ordinary skill in the art \\u201cto modify Lee, as taught by Ferlitsch to provide wherein said print job unit comprises . . . a fraction of an entire print job . . . to allow portions of a print job to be rendered by a host and other portions . . . to be rendered by a printer\\u201d (Ans. 7).  However, we agree with Appellants that Ferlitsch does not remedy these deficiencies because Ferlitsch \\u201cnever teaches or suggests determining, for each fraction of an entire print job, whether that fraction of the print job \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  13  can be more efficiently rendered by the printer or the host computer\\u201d (App. Br. 17).  That is, Ferlitsch\\u2019s apportioning of a rendering step to the computer or the printer is intentionally arbitrary, and not based on considerations of memory capacity, time or any other aspect of efficiency for an individual step. Claim 7, however, stands on a different footing.  Claim 7 depends from claim 1 (which we have determined is anticipated by Lee) and merely requires that the \\u201cprint job unit is partially rendered on said host computer and partially rendered on said printer.\\u201d   Here, we agree with the Examiner that it would have been obvious for one of ordinary skill in the art to use Ferlitsch\\u2019s load-balancing technique in Lee\\u2019s system when the system has determined that a print job unit exceeds the memory capacity of the printer. Accordingly, the rejection of claims 2, 7, 12, 18, and 23 as unpatentable over Lee and Ferlitsch is affirmed with respect to claim 7, and reversed with respect to claims 2, 12, 18, and 23. IV. Claim 11 stands rejected as unpatentable over Lee, AAPA, and Ferlitsch. Claim 11 requires converting a print job unit to a display list format on a host computer and transmitting the print job unit to a printer in display list format .  Since claim 11 depends from claim 8, it also requires determining whether each step in rendering the print job unit can be more rapidly completed on the host computer or the printer. The Examiner finds that \\u201cAAPA discloses that typical print job processing includes conversion to an intermediate format and then finally to \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  14  a rasterized format\\u201d (Ans. 10), while Lee teaches \\u201cthat rasterization can occur at the host PC side . . . [thus] intermediate display list generating should also have occurred on the host PC side\\u201d (id.), and concludes that it would have been obvious to \\u201cconvert[] said print job unit to a display list format on said host computer and transmitting said print job unit in display list format to said printer in order to process the print job in the fastest and most resource conscious way possible\\u201d (id. at 10-11). However, as discussed above, Lee does not disclose making a determination for each step of the rendering process, and neither the AAPA nor Ferlitsch remedies this deficiency, regardless of whether various rendering steps can be accomplished on the host computer. Accordingly, we will reverse this rejection. V.   Claims 6, 15, 16, 21, and 22 stand rejected as unpatentable over Lee and Kim.  Claim 6 depends from claim 1 and further requires \\u201can imaging algorithm . . . that determines where to render each print job unit\\u201d that \\u201ccan be selectively activated or deactivated by a user operating said host computer.\\u201d    Claims 15 and 16 depend directly or indirectly from claim 8 and further require determining whether each step in a rendering job is more efficiently completed on the host computer or the printer based on one or more specific parameters. Claims 21 and 22 depend directly or indirectly from the printer driver of claim 17 (discussed above), and also require determining whether each \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  15  step in a rendering job is more efficiently completed on the host computer or the printer based on one or more specific parameters.  The Examiner finds that Kim discloses \\u201ca printer driver setup screen for a user to set or de-set printer driver options and features related to printing speed\\u201d (Ans. 11, 12), and concludes that it would have been obvious to modify Lee to provide \\u201can imaging algorithm of said printer driver that determines where to render each print job unit [that] can be selectively activated or deactivated by a user operating said host computer\\u201d as \\u201cit is typical for many printer drivers to provide such options\\u201d (id. at 11).  In addition, the Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious \\u201cto provide that the determination is based on at least one of (1) a current application on said host computer; and (2) and any applicable user input\\u201d (id. at 12).  We will reverse this rejection.  As discussed above, Lee does not disclose making an efficiency determination for each step of the rendering process, and Kim\\u2019s disclosure of printer driver setup screen does not remedy the underlying deficiency of Lee. VI.   Claims 14 and 20 stand rejected as unpatentable over Lee and Brown.  Claims 14 and 20 depend from claims 13 and 17, respectively.  As we have already determined that Lee does not disclose all the limitations of claims 13 and 17, and Brown does not remedy this underlying deficiency, we will reverse this rejection as well. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-009679 Application 11/602,616  16  SUMMARY I. The rejection of claims 1, 4, 5, 8-10, 13, 17, and 19 as anticipated by Lee is affirmed with respect to claims 1 and 4, and reversed with respect to claims 5, 8-10, 13, 17, and 19.   II. The rejection of claim 3 as unpatentable over Lee and AAPA is affirmed. III. The rejection of claims 2, 7, 12, 18, and 23 as unpatentable over Lee and Ferlitsch is affirmed with respect to claim 7, and reversed with respect to claims 2, 12, 18, and 23. IV. The rejection of claim 11 as unpatentable over Lee, AAPA, and Ferlitsch is reversed. V. The rejection of claims 6, 15, 16, 21, and 22 as unpatentable over Lee and Kim is reversed. VI.

(App. Br. 2.)Appeal 2012-004231\\nApplication ll/73 7,694\\n\\nAppellants do not challenge the obviousness rejection as to any claim\\nlimitation of the claims at issue except for the limitatio11 requiring \\u201ca\\ntargeting ligand that targets an amino acid transporter.\\u201d Therefore, for the\\nclaims on appeal that do not require such a limitation, the obviousness\\nrejection is affinned.\\n\\nThe Examiner is correct that every compound de\\ufb01ned by claim 1 does\\nnot require a targeting ligand that targets an a1ni11o acid transporter. The\\nonly permutations of claim 1 that do require such a limitation occur when\\nthe following is true:\\n\\nA1= -(CH2)? and A3= -(CH;)2-V, and\\n\\neither A; a11d A4: \\u2014(CH2)3\\u2014, or A3 and A4: \\u2014(CH3)3\\u2014.\\n\\nLikewise, claims 2-4, 68-78 don\\u2019t require a targeting ligand that targets an\\nami11o acid transporter. Therefore, the obviousness rejection as to claim 1-4\\nand 68-78 is affirmed. Claims 50, 53-55, 57, 65-66, which ultimately\\ndepend on claim 1, claim a permutation that requires a targeting ligand that\\ntargets an ami11o acid transporter as set forth above. Therefore, the\\nobviousness rejection as to these claims is reversed. Claims 51, 52, 56, a11d\\n58-64, wl1icl1 ultimately depend 011 claim 1, do not claim a permutation that\\nrequires a targeting ligand that targets an a1ni11o acid transporter as set forth\\nabove. Therefore, the obviousness rejection as to these claims is af\\ufb01rmed.\\n\\nAppellants argue claim 67 separately. Appellants assert that claim 67\\nrequires at least one residue of alpha-methyltyrosine to be conjugated to one\\nor more of R1, R2, R3 a11d R4. (App. Br. 6.) We agree that the cited prior\\nart does not teach alpl1a-metl1yltyrosi11e conjugated to an N4 chelator.\\n\\nTherefore, the rejection as to this claim is reversed.\\n\\n10Appeal 2012-004231\\nApplication ll/73 7,694\\n\\nAppellants also argued claims I08-l l0 separately. Claim 108\\nrequires the ligand of claim 1 to be \\u201can amino acid or a11 amino acid\\nderivative.\\u201d (App. Br. l6.) Claim I09 requires that the amino acid or amino\\nacid derivative of claim l08 to be \\u201cserine, tryptophan, tyrosine or a tyrosine\\nderivative.\\u201d ([d.) Claim 1 l0 requires that the tyrosine derivative of claim\\nl08 is \\u201cd-[3-tyrosine, tyrosine or 0t-methyltyrosine.\\u201d Because none of the\\ncited prior art teaches a single amino acid as a targeting ligand as explained\\n\\nabove, the obviousness rejection as to these claims is also reversed.\\n\\nSUMMARY\\nWe affirm the rejection of claims 1-4, 51, 52, 56, 58-64, a11d 68-78\\n\\nunder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103 (a) as unpatentable over Meade in view of Morrow\\n\\na11d Smith.\\nWe reverse the rejection of claims 50, 53-55, 57, 65-67, and 108-110\\nunder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103 (a) as unpatentable over Meade in view of Morrow\\n\\na11d Smith.\\n\\nTIME PERIOD FOR RESPONSE\\nNo time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with\\nthis appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 l.l36(a).

(Id.\\n6-7.) Appellants particularly point out that claim 67 lists the structures of\\ntwo amino acids, alpha-methyltyrosine and OLB-tyrosine, that are not found in\\nproteins. (Reply Br. 2.)\\n\\nThe Examiner responds that claim 1, i11 describing the R1, R3, R3, and\\nR4 functional groups, uses the disjunctive so that a targeting ligand or linker\\ntargeting ligand that targets a11 amino acid transporter is 11ot required for\\nevery permutation of the claimed compound. (Ans. 9.) The Examiner also\\nasserts that because Meade teaches that the TAAGM comprises functional\\ngroups of amino acid side chains, amino- or carboxyl- termini, or single\\n\\namino acid residues for chemical attachment on the chelator, Meade\\u2019sAppeal 2012-004231\\nApplication ll/73 7,694\\n\\ncomposition meets the requirement for an N4 chelator that has a targeting\\nligand that targets a11 amino acid transporter.

(See FF 1 1.) We agree with\\nAppellants that Smith does not teach a11 amino acid as a targeting agent for\\nan amino acid transporter. (See App. Br. 5; Reply Br. 3.) We also find that\\nMeade does 11ot teach this. While Meade teaches proteinaceous TAAGMs\\nthat have functional groups on the amino acid side chains or the an1ino- or\\ncarboxyI- termini of the protein, Meade does not teach a targeting ligand that\\ntargets an amino acid transporter. (See FF l\\u20142; see Meade, col. 22, l. 62 \\u2014\\ncol 23, I. 7 (teaching use of a single amino acid residue as a guarding moiety\\nwl1en a11 enzyme cancer target substance is a protease)).\\n\\nSmith likewise teaches peptides, not single amino acids, as targeting\\nagents conjugated to bi\\u2014functional liga11ds. (See FF 3-4.) The listing of\\nsingle a1ni11o acids such as tyrosine, histidine, and tryptophan i11 Table 7\\nmerely refers to sites on a target agent, such as a protein, and not as a target\\nagents i11 a11d of themselves. (See FF 5.) Such a reading of Table 7 is\\ncon\\ufb01rmed by the description of the method used to conjugate bi\\u2014functional\\nliga11ds to target agents with these ami11o acid sites. Smith teaches that the\\nmethod \\u201c[o]ften results i11 extensive precipitation due to intra-antibody a11d\\ninter-antibody cross-linking\\u201d indicating that the target agent is not a single\\namino acid. (See FF 6.)\\n\\nBecause the cited references fail to teach \\u201ca targeting ligand that\\ntargets an amino acid transporter,\\u201d claims at issue that require this limitation\\nare not rendered obvious by the cited references. Only some of the claims at\\n\\nissue, however, require such a targeting ligand. (See App. Br. 9-16.)'},\n",

See also MPEP Rev. 8, July 2010.\\n\\n3Appeal 201 l-004454\\nApplication l0/926,653\\n\\nCONTEN TION S\\nAppellants contend, inter alia:\\n\\nLanigan does not disclose or suggest the features of a gateway\\nconnecting said \\ufb01rst bus and said second bus, said gateway\\nproviding centralized means for bidirectionally controlling said\\nfirst device fro111 said second device, wherein said gateway\\nsupports a con\\ufb01guration of said \\ufb01rst device and said second\\ndevice being on the same bus, or said con\\ufb01guration of \\ufb01rst\\ndevice being on a different bus fron1 that of said second device.\\nNarasimhan does not cure the de\\ufb01ciencies of Lanigan\\n\\nwith respect to claim 1. Therefore, the rejection of claim 1\\n\\nunder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a\\u201c), should be reversed.\\n\\n(App. Br. 7).\\nANALYSIS\\n\\nIssue: Under \\xa7 103, did the Examiner err in \\ufb01nding the cited combination of\\n\\nreferences would have taught or suggested the following limitations (labeled\\n\\nLl-L2):\\n\\n[Ll] a gateway connecting said first bus and said second bus,\\nsaid gateway providing centralized means _/or bidirectionally\\ncontrolling said first device from said second device, wherein\\nsaid gateway supports a configuration of said first device and\\nsaid second device being on the same bus, or said configuration\\nof\\ufb01rst device being on a different bus from that ofsaid second\\ndevice;\\n\\n. and\\n[L2] if control is decentralized,\\n\\nproviding, by said gateway, of a control application to\\nsaid second device for execution by said second device; and\\n\\nsaid control application allowing direct control of said\\nfirst device from said second device,\\n\\nwithin the meaning of representative clai111 l?Appeal 201 l-004454\\nApplication 10/926,653\\n\\nRegarding the primary Lanigan reference, Appellants particularly\\ncontend \\u201cLanigan does not allow HAVi devices on the \\ufb01rst network to\\ncontrol UPnP devices on the second network, i.e., the control is not\\nbidirectional.\\u201d Appellants explain:\\n\\nThe control means of Lanigan is provided by a UPnP device in\\nthe UPnP network, and not provided by a gateway which is\\naccessible for devices on botl1 buses, as in Appellants\\u2019 claim 1.\\nAs such, Appellants respectfully submit that the bz\\'a\\u2019z\\'recti0I7al\\ncontrol of the devices is not an inherent aspect of Lanigan\\u2019s\\nHaven\\u2014UPnP bridge.\\n\\nFurthermore, nowhere does Lanigan disclose or suggest\\nbidirectional control. For example, controller 35 is situated not\\non the bridge but clearly in the second network, and offers its\\nfunctions to devices of the second network only. As discussed\\nin Appellants\\u2019 response dated January 8, 2010, paragraph 30 of\\nLanigan discloses a node in the second UPnP network proposes\\na user interface which allows a user to control any node on\\neither network. This is unidirectional control: the control is only\\npossible for UPnP devices, which can control either other UPnP\\ndevices on the second network or HAVi devices on the \\ufb01rst\\nnetwork.\\n\\n(App. Br. 8, 1l1ll\\u20142, emphasis added).\\n\\nRegarding the secondary Narasimhan reference, Appellants contend:\\n\\nAt col. 2, lines 40-54, Narasimhan merely discusses controlling\\nof network devices with a single integrated circuit chip. At col.\\n14, lines 7-9, Narasimhan merely discusses that a network\\ninterface chip 36 of fig. 8 appears to a Device Circuit 38 as a\\nbidirectional 8 bit data port, which simply means that Device\\nCircuit 38 can transmit and receive data to, respectively fro111\\nnetwork 32. Thus, Narasimhan does not disclose or suggest the\\nbidirectional control of devices on a same or different network\\nby devices on a sa111e or different network, as required by\\nAppellants\\u2019 claim l.Appeal 201 1-004454\\nApplication 10/926,653\\n\\n(App. Br. 8, 11111-2. emphasis added).\\n\\nAt the outset, we note the EXan1iner\\u2019s obviousness rejection is based\\non the combination of Lanigan and Narasimhan. Finding no express\\nteaching in Lanigan of bia\\u2019irecti0mt/ control of a first device by a second\\ndevice, the Examiner turns to Narasimhan for a general teaching of\\nbidirectionally controlling equipment over co111puter networks using a single\\ndevice. (Narasimhan col. 2, 11. 40-54, and col. 14, 11. 7-9; see also Ans. 6).\\n\\nOur reviewing court guides \\u201cit is not necessary that the inventions of\\nthe references be physically combinable to render obvious the invention\\nunder review.\" In re Sneed, 710 F.2d 1544, 1550 Fed. Cir. 1983 (citing\\nOrt/mpea\\u2019ic Equip. Co. v. United States, 702 F.2d 1005, 1013 (Fed. Cir.\\n1983); In re Andersen, 391 F.2d 953, 958 (CCPA 1968)); see also In re\\nNievelt, 482 F.2d 965, 968 (CCPA l973) (\\u201cCombining the teachings of\\nreferences does not involve an ability to combine their speci\\ufb01c structures\\u201d).\\n\\u201cThe test for obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary\\nreference may be bodily incorporated into the structure of the primary\\nreference . . . . Rather, the test is what the combined teachings of the\\nreferences would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art.\\u201d In re\\nKeller, 642 F.2d 413, 425 (CCPA 1981).\\n\\nThis reasoning is applicable here. Thus, we find Lanigan\\u2019s bridge 40\\n(Figs. 1-2) (i.e., gateway), when co111bined witl1 the bia\\u2019irecti0nal control\\nfeatures of Narasimhan (col. 14, 1. 7), would have taught or suggested the\\nclaimed gateway that provides centralized means for bidirectionally\\n\\ncontrolling a \\ufb01rst device from a second device. We particularly note theAppeal 201 1-004454\\nApplication 10/926,653\\n\\nalternative \\u201cor\\u201d language recited in claim 1 regarding the two respective\\ndevice bus con\\ufb01gurations:\\n\\n[Ll] a gateway connecting said first bus and said second bus,\\nsaid gateway providing centralized means for bidirectionally\\ncontrolling said \\ufb01rst device from said second device, wherein\\nsaid gateway supports a configuration Qfsaid first device and\\nsaid second device being on the same bus, Q said configuration\\nqffirst device being on a different bus from that Q/\\u2018said second\\ndevice;\\n\\n(emphasis added).\\n\\nWe find the EXaininer\\u2019s proffered combination teaches the first device\\n(Lanigan\\u2019s node 35, Fig. 2) which is able to access a User Interface (Ul)\\nfrom Lanigan\\u2019s bridge 40 (i.e., centralized gateway) for Lanigan\\u2019s devices\\n(second devices 25, 26, 27, Fig. 2) within the HAVi network 20 and use it to\\ncontrol them. See particularly Lanigan, para. [0030), where we find\\nLanigan\\u2019s bridge 40 teaches or suggests the claimed gateway that provides\\ncentralized means for bidirectionally controlling a first device from a second\\ndevice, when Lanigan\\u2019s gateway is combined with Narasimhan\\u2019s\\nbidirectional feature. (Narasimhan, col. 2, ll. 40-54, and col. 14, 11. 7-9).\\n\\nThus, we \\ufb01nd the Examiner\\u2019s proffered combination teaches or\\nsuggests at least the second (\\u201cor\\u201d) alternative condition where the claimed\\nfirst device (Lanigan, 35) and second device (Lanigan, 25, 26, 27) are on\\ndi\\ufb02erent buses (UPnP bus for device 35, and a HAVi bus for devices 25, 26,\\nand 27).\\n\\nAs a matter of claim construction regarding the recited terms\\n\\u201ccentralized\\u201d and \\u201cdecentralized,\\u201d we conclude these are relative terms that\\nonly have meaning only in juxtaposition to other elements. Regarding\\n\\nindependent claims 1 and 6 on appeal, we observe these claims do notAppeal 201 1-004454\\nApplication 10/926,653\\n\\npositively recite exactly what elements the claimed gateway is \\u201ccentralized\\u201d\\nor \\u201cdecentralized\\u201d with respect to. Moreover, regarding conditional\\nlimitation L2 (\\u201cif control is decentralized . . .\\u201d), we conclude representative\\nclaim 1 does not positively recite whether this condition is ever aelually\\nreached. Therefore, a question arises as to 110w much patentable weight, if\\nany, should be accorded to the aforementioned recited conditional limitation\\nL2.\\n\\nOn this record, we are in accord witli the Examiner\\u2019s \\ufb01ndings\\nregarding conditional limitation L2. (See Ans. 6). We particularly observe\\nLanigan uses a \\u201ccontroller [that] may be a Java applet such as a HAVi ML\\n\\nhavlet.\\u201d (Lanigan, 1] [0016]). We agree with the Examiner that Lanigan\\u2019s\\n\\nJava applet (ia\\u2019.) teaches or suggests the claimed \\u201ccontrol application.\\u201d (Ans.\\n\\n6). This reading of the recited \\u201ccontrol application\" (claim 1) on Lanigan\\u2019s\\nJava applet is fully consistent with Appellants\\u2019 Speci\\ufb01cation which\\ndescribes the similar use of a Java program: \\u201cthe client is capable of\\nexecuting the Java program transmitted and has the software layer\\ninterfacing Java with the high level control protocol (HAVi, UPnP, etc.).\\u201d\\n(Spec. 8, 11. 25-27).\\n\\nThe Supreme Court guides that \\u201cwhen a patent \\u2018simply arranges old\\nelements with each performing the sa111e function it had been known to\\nperform\\u2019 and yields no more than one would expect from such an\\narrangement, the combination is obvious.\\u201d KSR Int\\u2019! Co. v. T e/e\\ufb02ex, 1170.,\\n550 US. 398, 417 (2007) (quoting Sakraida v. /lg Pro, Inc, 425 US. 273,\\n282 (1976)). This reasoning is applicable here. In considering the teachings\\nand suggestions of Lanigan\\u2019s bridge 40 (Figs 1-2) (i.e. gateway) when used\\n\\nin combination with Narasimhan\\u2019s bidirectional feature, on this record, weAppeal 201 l-004454\\nApplication 10/926,653\\n\\nare not persuaded of error regarding the Exan1iner\\u2019s underlying factual\\n\\ufb01ndings and ultimate legal conclusion of obviousness.\\n\\nln the Reply Brief, Appellants advance a new argument that \\u201cthe\\nExaminer has failed to provide an adequate reason for combining the\\nteachings of Lanigan and N arasimhan.\\u201d (Reply Br. 7, ll. 5-6). However, we\\nfind this argument untimely. \\u201cAny bases for asserting error, whether factual\\nor legal, that are not raised in the principal brief are waived.\\u201d Ex parte\\nBorden, 93 USPQ2d 1473, 1474 (BPAl 2010) (informative).

KIMLIN, CATHERINE Q. TIMM, and ROMULO H. DELMENDO, Administrative Patent Judges.  KIMLIN, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL   This is an appeal from the final rejection of claims 5, 6, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, and 25-30.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  Claim 5 is illustrative:  5.   A method for controlling a temperature of a laser module having at least one laser diode driven in a modulated manner for imaging a printing form in an exposer, and a Peltier element, which comprises the steps of:   cooling the laser module by leading heat from the laser module to the Peltier element through a heat conduit; and  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007469 Application 11/495,137     2 driving the Peltier element in an analog manner by using a bipolar power unit driven digitally in a clocked manner in accordance with a  principle of pulse width modulation.     The Examiner relies upon the following references as evidence of obviousness: Reimer et al. (Reimer) 5,608,748   Mar. 4, 1997 Ichino    US 2003/0231665 A1 Dec. 18, 2003 Rice    6,724,792 B2  Apr. 20, 2004  Sato    JP 09-023035 A  Jan. 21, 1997   Appellants\\' claimed invention is directed to a method for controlling a temperature of a laser module.  The method entails cooling the module by leading heat away from the module to a Peltier element through a heat conduit, and driving the Peltier element in an analog manner by using a bipolar power unit driven digitally in a clocked manner in accordance with a principle of pulse width modulation.    The appealed claims stand rejected under 35 U.S.C \\xa7 103(a) as follows:  (a)  claims 5, 6, and 26-29 over Rice in view of Ichino,  (b)  claims 12, 18, 20, 22, 23, and 25 over Rice in view of Reimer and Ichino,  (c)  claims 15 over Rice in view of Reimer, Ichino and Sato, and  (d)  claim 30 over Rice in view of Ichino and Sato.     Appellants do not separately argue any particular claim on appeal.  Accordingly, all the appealed claims stand or fall together with claim 5. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007469 Application 11/495,137     3 We have thoroughly reviewed each of Appellants\\' arguments for patentability.  However, it is our judgment that the Examiner\\'s legal conclusion of obviousness for the claimed subject matter is free of reversible error.  Accordingly, we will sustain the Examiner\\'s rejection for the reasons set forth in the Answer.   Appellants do not dispute the Examiner\\'s factual determination that Rice, like Appellants, discloses cooling a laser module by leading heat from the module to a Peltier element through a heat conduit.  The Examiner appreciates that Rice does not teach driving the Peltier element in an analog manner by using a bipolar unit driven digitally in a clocked manner in accordance with a principle of pulse width modulation.  However, the Examiner finds that Ichino drives the Peltier element in the manner claimed by disclosing that \\u201c[t]he temperature control circuit 31 generates an analog signal 68 corresponding to the target temperature and sends this signal to the Peltier drive circuit 32\" [0037]).  Appellants, on the other hand, although acknowledging that the digital drive device of the present invention can be driven depending on the temperature, contend that \"Ichino does not disclose driving the power unit is a clocked manner in accordance with a principle of pulse width modulation\" (Reply Br. 3, penultimate para.).  Appellants, however, do not address with persuasive factual evidence rather than mere attorney arguments, the following factual finding of the Examiner:  In response to argument that the Peltier element of Ichino is not driven according to the frequency or modulation of the laser element, examiner notes that there is a direct causal effect on the temperature of the laser element and the modulation of that laser element and that any driving based on the detected temperature of the laser element would also necessarily be \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007469 Application 11/495,137     4based on the modulation of the laser element.  Following this interpretation of what the claim, at its broadest, requires, examiner concludes that the driving scheme utilized by Ichino satisfies the basic requirement of the claim that the Peltier device be driven in accordance with the principle of pulse width modulation because the Peltier device is driven according to detected temperature.   (Ans. 12, second para.).  Consequently, since the Examiner\\'s position, which is reasonable on its face, stands unrebutted by Appellants, it is accepted here.  Appellants have pointed to no error in the Examiner\\'s finding that Ichino\\'s driving of the Peltier element based on the detected temperature of the laser element necessarily results in a modulation of the laser element and a driving of the Peltier device in accordance with the principle of pulse width modulation.   As a final point, we note that Appellants base no argument upon objective evidence of nonobviousness, such as unexpected results.   In conclusion, based on the foregoing, the Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting the appealed claims is affirmed.   The decision of the Examiner is affirmed.   No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iv). AFFIRMED      cam \\x0c'},\n",

BROWNE, ANNETTE R. REIMERS and CARL M. DeFRANCO, Administrative Patent Judges.  REIMERS, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL           \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011251 Application 10/864,108  2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE Shoichi Endo and Alexander Jasso (Appellants) appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from the Examiner\\u2019s decision to reject under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a):  (1) claims 1-13, 16-21, 23, 24, 26-34, 36-40 and 42-48 as unpatentable over Woolston (US 6,162,123; iss. Dec. 19, 2000) and Shahoian (US 6,693,622 B1; iss. Feb. 17, 2004); and (2) claims 14, 15, 25 and 41 as unpatentable over Woolston, Shahoian and DeMenthon (US 5,388,059; iss. Feb. 7, 1995).  Claims 22, 35 and 49-53 have been canceled.  We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We AFFIRM. THE INVENTION Appellants\\u2019 invention \\u201crelate[s] to interactive gaming systems with haptic feedback.\\u201d  Spec.1, para. [0002]; fig. 2.  Claims 1, 23 and 36 are independent. Claim 1 is illustrative of the claimed invention and is reproduced below: 1. An apparatus, comprising: a portable manipulandum configured to simulate an element associated with a physical activity; an actuator disposed in the portable manipulandum, wherein the actuator comprises one of a pager motor, an eccentric mass actuator, a harmonic eccentric mass actuator, an inertial mass harmonic actuator, a voice coil, a moving magnet actuator, a piezoelectric actuator, or an electro-active polymer actuator; a sensor in communication with the portable manipulandum and configured to detect a movement of the portable manipulandum; and a processor in communication with the sensor and the actuator, the processor configured to receive a sensor \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011251 Application 10/864,108  3 signal from the sensor associated with the movement of the portable manipulandum and to output a control signal to the actuator based at least in part on the sensor signal, the control signal configured to cause the actuator to output a haptic feedback associated with the movement of the portable manipulandum, the haptic feedback comprising a vibrotactile effect.  ANALYSIS Obviousness over Woolston and Shahoian - Claims 1-13, 16-21, 23, 24,  26-34, 36-40 and 42-48  Appellants do not present separate arguments for independent claims 1, 23 and 36.  Br. 8-9.  Appellants do not present additional arguments for dependent claims 2-13, 16-21, 24, 26-34, 37-40 and 42-48 separate from those directed against the rejection of independent claims 1, 23 and 36.  Id. at 9.  Accordingly, Appellants have argued claims 1-13, 16-21, 23, 24, 26-34, 36-40 and 42-48 as a group for purposes of the rejection of those claims under \\xa7 103(a).  Claim 1 is representative of the group and is selected for review, with claims 2-13, 16-21, 23, 24, 26-34, 36-40 and 42-48 standing or falling with claim 1.  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii)(2011).  Independent claim 1 recites \\u201cthe control signal configured to cause the actuator to output a haptic feedback associated with the movement of the portable manipulandum, the haptic feedback comprising a vibrotactile effect.\\u201d  Br., Claims Appendix.  The Examiner finds that \\u201c[a]lthough Woolston discloses the actuator comprising a gyroscope to output a \\u2018topple\\u2019 haptic or force feedback, it is known in the art that gyroscopes can also be used to create reaction torques which are felt by the user as vibrations (i.e. vibrotactile effect) as evidenced by Shahoian.\\u201d  Ans. 4 (citing Shahoian, col. 19, ll. 20-30).  The Examiner further finds that \\u201calthough Woolston focused \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011251 Application 10/864,108  4 on providing a toppling effect as the haptic feedback, it does not mean all other types of haptic feedbacks [cannot] be used.  When a sword is [struck] against another object, it can alternatively cause the sword to vibrate.\\u201d  Final Rej. 2.  The Examiner concludes that \\u201cproviding a vibrotactile effect as taught by Shahoian to Woolston\\u2019s sword would be obvious in order to make the haptic [touch] feedback feel more realistic.\\u201d  Id. Appellants contend that \\u201c[t]he types of forces disclosed in Woolston are very different from the types of forces that may be output by the actuators disclosed in Shahoian, and thus, simple substitution of Shahoian's actuators would render the Woolston device unsuitable for its intended purpose of outputting torsional \\u2018toppling forces.\\u2019\\u201d  Br. 7.  According to Appellants, one of skill in the art reading Woolston in view of Shahoian would not attempt to generate vibrotactile effects in the Woolston device, because the Woolston device is intended to output torsional forces on the user and Woolston does not suggest that other types of forces would be desirable. Further, Shahoian\\u2019s actuators are not disclosed to output the torsional forces in Woolston, and thus there is no need to include such unsuitable actuators. As such, even though both applications are related to haptics, one of skill in the art would not combine Woolston with Shahoian because the effects and actuators of Shahoian are unsuitable for the Woolston device.  Id. at 8.  Appellants\\u2019 arguments are not persuasive.  First, we fail to see, and Appellants have failed to explain, how the Examiner\\u2019s proposed modification to Woolston\\u2019s sword to include the vibrotactile effect as taught by Shahoian would render Woolston unsatisfactory for its intended purpose of outputting torsional \\u201ctoppling forces.\\u201d  Further, Appellants\\u2019 arguments do \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011251 Application 10/864,108  5 not address the Examiner\\u2019s proposed combination of Woolston and Shahoian.  Ans. 4-5, 10; Final Rej. 2.  The Examiner is not proposing to substitute Shahoian\\u2019s actuators for Woolston\\u2019s actuators, as Appellants contend.  Rather, the Examiner is proposing to modify Woolston\\u2019s actuator to include the vibrotactile effects disclosed in Shahoian.  In other words, the Examiner is proposing to modify Woolston\\u2019s sword by incorporating vibrations, as taught by Shahoian, \\u201cin order to make the haptic [touch] feedback feel more realistic.\\u201d  Final Rej. 2.  Appellants acknowledge that both Woolston and Shahoian disclose haptic (touch) feedback devices.  Br. 8.  Woolston discloses that (1) \\u201c[t]he new player interface apparatus may be a hand held apparatus that may use sensors to determine the position of the apparatus and the gyrostatic effect to provide tactile [touch] feedback to the user\\u201d (Woolston, col 2, ll. 38-41); and (2) \\u201c[c]ontained within the sword housing is a gyrostatic propulsion device from which the gyrostatic toppling effect is utilized to create a torque and/or the feel of sword blows on the sword handle and, thus, on the player holding the sword apparatus (Woolston, col. 2, ll. 50-54) (emphasis added); see also Ans. 4.  Woolston further discloses that [b]y applying the appropriate voltage to the high torque motors, the propulsion gyrostat may be \\u201ctoppled\\u201d in such a way as to create a calibrated torque on the whole sword apparatus, e.g., the sword housing. This calibrated torque may be used to simulate, inter alia, a sword blow as felt at a sword\\u2019s handle. Through the interaction of successive sword blows, e.g., torque provided by the propulsion gyrostat to provide the \\u201cfeel\\u201d of sword blows, and interactions with virtual swordsman opponents, the present invention provides a novel and exciting interactive sword \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011251 Application 10/864,108  6 game that physically involves the player interactivity with the game.  Woolston, col. 2, l. 64 - col. 3, l. 8 (emphasis added); see also Ans. 4.  Similarly, Shahoian discloses that (1) \\u201c[t]he present invention relates generally to producing forces in haptic [touch] feedback interface devices and more particularly to the output and control of vibrations and similar force sensations from actuators in a haptic [touch] feedback interface device\\u201d (Shahoian, col. 1, ll. 23-27); and (2) \\u201c[i]n another embodiment, a gyroscope can be provided in a housing.  Disturbing the gyroscope generates forces . . . Small actuators can be used to disturb the frame and create reaction torques which are felt by the user as vibrations\\u201d (Shahoian, col. 19, ll. 21-27) (emphasis added); see also Ans. 4. Because Woolston and Shahoian disclose similar haptic (touch) feedback devices including gyroscopes that generate torsional forces (torque) felt by the user, we agree with the Examiner that it would have been obvious to modify Woolston\\u2019s sword to include a vibrotactile effect (vibration), as taught by Shahoian, \\u201cin order to make the haptic [touch] feedback feel more realistic.\\u201d Final Rej. 2.  In other words, in the modified Woolston sword, the sword blow would include a vibrotactile effect (vibration) \\u201cfelt\\u201d by the user at the sword\\u2019s handle, which would make the haptic (touch) feedback feel more realistic.  This is merely the application of an improvement (i.e., vibration) known from the teachings of Shahoian to the similar haptic feedback device disclosed by Woolston.  Appellants have not provided any evidence or argument sufficient to show that such an improvement would have been beyond the level of ordinary skill in the art.  Neither have Appellants provided any persuasive evidence or argument \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011251 Application 10/864,108  7 sufficient to show that the proposed improvement would have been more than a predictable use of the prior art elements according to their established functions. Appellants\\u2019 assertions that \\u201cWoolston does not disclose that any of the forces disclosed in Shahoian would be desirable in the Woolston apparatus, nor does Shahoian disclose a toppling effect produced by other types of actuators that might be incorporated into the Woolston device\\u201d (Br. 8) are not persuasive for two reasons.  First, Appellants\\u2019 arguments are individual attacks on the references rather than a challenge to the Examiner\\u2019s combination of the teachings of the two references.  See In re Merck & Co., Inc., 800 F.2d 1091 (Fed. Cir. 1986); In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413 (CCPA 1981) (one cannot show nonobviousness by attacking references individually where the rejections are based on combinations of references).  Second, to the extent Appellants are arguing the references must be capable of bodily incorporation in order to combine their teachings, the test for obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary reference may be bodily incorporated into the structure of a primary reference.  In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 425 (CCPA 1981).  \\u201cRather, the test is what the combined teachings of the references would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art.\\u201d  Id. (citations omitted).   Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the rejection of claim 1 and claims 2-13, 16-21, 23, 24, 26-34, 36-40 and 42-48, which fall with claim 1, as unpatentable over Woolston and Shahoian is sustained.  Obviousness over Woolston, Shahoian and DeMenthon - Claims 14, 15, 25 and 41 Appellants contend that  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011251 Application 10/864,108  8 Claims 14, 15, 25, and 41 depend from one of independent claims 1, 23, or 36. For the reasons given above, claims 1, 23, and 36 are each patentable over Woolston in view of Shahoian. DeMenthon does not cure this deficiency. DeMenthon discloses a sensor comprising a video camera, but does not add any disclosure relevant to the arguments presented above.   Br. 9.  As discussed above, we are not persuaded by these arguments.  Accordingly, we also sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 14, 15, 25, and 41 as unpatentable over Woolston, Shahoian and DeMenthon.  DECISION We AFFIRM the decision of the Examiner to reject claims 1-21,  23-34 and 36-48.  No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iv).  AFFIRMED         rvb \\x0c\"},\n",

Any claim not separately argued will stand or fall with the argued\\n\\nclai111s from wl1icl1 it depends. See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(Vii).\\n\\nRejections 1, 2, and 3\\n\\nAppellants submit that Muellenheim does not teach a powder partially\\n\\ufb01lling the cavity wherein the powder is not mixed with other materials (Br.\\n5; Reply Br. 2). Appellants argue that the powder in Muellenheim is mixed\\nwitl1 a casting compound to form a mixture, and then placed in the container.\\nAppellants refer to Muellenheim col. 1, ll. 57- 59, and col. 2, l. 67 through\\ncol. 3, l. 10, in this regard. Reply Br. 1.\\n\\nHowever, Muellenheim also discloses another embodiment wherein\\nthe powder is not mixed with a casting compound, as the Examiner found\\naccording to his rejection set forth on page 4 of the Answer, and further\\nexplained on page 19 of tl1e Answer. Figure 1 of Muellenhei111 depicts\\npowder 29 surrounded by the wall of the container 28, and if embedded in\\ncasting compound, by the casting co111pound 30. Muellenhei111, col. 2, ll. 57-\\n60. Casting compound 30 is not mixed with the powder; rather, it surrounds\\nthe power 29, as explained by the Examiner in the Answer.

(Ans. 19). Appellants have not\\ndirected us to a disclosure in Muellenheim that discloses the cavity is\\n\\ncompletely \\ufb01lled by the powder}\\n\\nHence, we are not convinced by Appellants\\u2019 arguments, and affirm\\nRejection 1. Because Appellants rely upon the sa111e arguments with respect\\n\\nto Rejection 2 (Br. 6), we also af\\ufb01rm Rejection 2 for the same reasons.\\n\\nWith respect to Rejection 3, Appellants rely in part on the same\\narguments, and additionally, sub111it that with respect to claims 6-8, the\\nmethods and techniques used in Jaklic for sealing multiple square-phase\\nlocked cores component that comprises a layer of epoxy (claim 6), a layer of\\n\\nresin (claim 7), and a particle micro\\u2014 coating (claim 8) are \\u201cnot portable\\u201d to\\n\\n3 Moreover, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have sufficient skill to\\ndetermine the appropriate amount ofpowder to utilize in the cavity based on\\nMuellenheim\\u2019s disclosure that the magnetically conductive material\\n(powder) is utilized to set the leakage inductance.

Br. 7. Reply Br. 2-3.\\n\\nHowever, we concur with the Examiner\\u2019s response made on page 22\\n\\nof the Answer. Therein, the Examiner correctly explains that:\\n\\n[b]otl1 Jaklic and Muellenhei111 teach an inductive component\\nencapsulated in a container or a case. Though the components may be\\nin different form that does not change the fact that the components are\\ninductive. If the inductive component of Jaklic could comprises [sic] a\\nlayer of epoxy (claim 6\\u2018), a layer of resin (claim 7\\u201c), and a particle\\nmicro\\u2014coating (claim 8,), a person with ordinary skill in the art at the\\ntime the invention was made could transfer the methods and\\nteclmiques of the layer of epoxy (claim 6), the layer of resin (claim 7),\\nand the particle micro-coating (claim 8) to the inductive component of\\nMuellenheim for the same reason as of J aklic.\\n\\nWe note that the prior art can be modi\\ufb01ed or combined to reiecr\\nclaims as j?I\\'\\xa7I}l\\xa3Z_\\ufb01\\u2019ZCl}? obvious as long as there is a reasonable expectation of\\nsuccess.

Therein, the Examiner recognizes that\\nSaegusa does not teach an electrical inductor co111prising at least one\\ninner shell disposed inside said at least one wire wound core, and therefore\\nrelies upon F astner for teaching an electrical inductor (F astner, Figures 1-4)\\ncomprising at least one inner shell 17 disposed inside said at least one wire\\n11 wound core 10 (Fastner, col. 3, lines 9-16). The Examiner concludes\\nthat it would have been obvious to have incorporated the inner shell\\n\\nstructure of Fastner into the electrical inductor of Saegusa \\u201cto facilitate\\n\\nmanufacturing or assembly and to reduce manufacturing cost\\u201d (F astner, col.\\n\\n3, lines 10-13, col. 1, lines 35-39\\u2018).\\n\\nAppellants argue that the hollow center coil around which a\\nconducting wire is wound, as described in Saegusa, cannot be combined\\nwith the toroidal core ofFastner. Br. 8-9. Appellants submit that Saegusa\\ndoes not teach a wire wound core. Appellants argue that the design of\\nSaegusa is directed to a very different inductor type than the type used in\\nFastner. Appellants submit one would not have looked to Saegusa\\'s\\ndisclosure for determining encapsulating methods for use with a toroidal\\nwire-wound core as described in Fastner. Id. See also page 3 of the Reply\\n\\nBrief.\\n\\nWe are not convinced by such arguments for the reasons provided by\\nthe Examiner in his response made on page 23 of the Answer. Therein, the\\n\\nExaminer states:Appeal 2011-007852\\nApplication 1 l/942,105\\n\\nA person with ordinary skill in the art knows the inductive component\\nof Saegusa and Fastner are fundamentally the same. Saegusa discloses\\nwire-woimd on toroidal air core. The air core is \\ufb01lled with magnetic\\npowder to have magnetic properties. F astner shows a wire\\u2014wound on a\\ntoroidal magnetic core. Therefore, a person with ordinary skill in the\\nart would look to Saegusa\\'s disclosure for determining encapsulating\\nmethods to use with a toroidal wire\\u2014wound core as described in\\nFastner. As such the Exa1niner\\u2018s combination is not improper.\\n\\nOn page 3 of the Reply Brief, Appellants disagree with the\\nExaminer\\u2019s position that the inductive component of Saegusa and Fastner\\nare \\u201cftmdamentally the same\". Appellants argue that the Examiner ignores\\nobvious incompatibilities and differences in the structures and operation of\\nSaegusa and Fastner and Inoue, and as such, housing techniques and\\nmethods are not portable to the design of Saegusa. However, Appellants do\\nnot explain why the asserted differences would amount to an unreasonable\\nlikelihood of success in making the proposed modifications as explained by\\n\\nthe Examiner. As such, we are not convinced by such argument.\\n\\nAppellants then argue that Saegusa teaches against the Examiner\\'s\\nproposed combination with Fastner (to facilitate manufacturing or assembly\\nand to reduce cost). Appellants state that Saegusa makes it clear that the\\nabsence of a center core leads to manufacturing advantages (col. 2, lines 45-\\n56). Appellants contend that the hollow core design of Saegusa teaches\\naway from disposing any core inside the hollow winding. Appellants assert\\nthat the additional material to fonn the shell in Fastner would not reasonably\\nlower the cost associated with Saegusa, and that Fastner\\'s shell would not\\nimprove upon the degree of tl1e freedom of formation in manufacturing\\n\\nSaegusa\\'s inductor. Br. 8-9.Appeal 2011-007852\\nApplication 1 l/942,105\\n\\nWe are not convinced by sucl1 arguments for the reasons provided by\\n\\nthe Examiner in his response on page 24 of the Answer. Therein, the\\n\\nExaminer states:\\n\\nBy having the inner shell as disclosed in F astner, the coil of Saegusa\\nwill be assured to be inserted in the container at a desired location\\neasily, thereby improving manufacturing or assembly, and production\\ncost. Without the inner shell, the coil might be placed too close to the\\ncontainer or too far from one side, or at undesired place in general,\\nand that might require manual adjustment to locate the coil at a\\ndesired position. Without adjustment, electrical characteristics might\\nget compromised. Again, the hollow coil of Saegusa is \\ufb01lled with\\nmagnetic powder to have magnetic characteristics as the magnetic\\ncore of Fastner. Therefore. Saegusa does not teach away from the\\nadvantage of tl1e absence of tl1e core. As such, the prima facie\\nobviousness is clearly established.\\n\\nNotably, Appellants do not speci\\ufb01cally respond to the Examiner\\u2019s\\n\\nabove-quoted position in their Reply Brief. Reply Br. 3.\\n\\nln View of tl1e above, we affirm Rejection 4. Because Appellants rely\\nupon the same arguments for Rejection 5 (Br. 9), we also af\\ufb01rm Rejection 5\\n\\nfor the same reasons.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DECISION\\nEach rejection is af\\ufb01rmed.\\nNo time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with\\nthis appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 l.l36(a)(l).\\nAFFIRMED\\n\\nbar'},\n",

See generally Spec. 1. Claim 1 is illustrative:\\n\\nl. A computer\\u2014based method for creating a data structure for informal\\ngeographic spaces, co111prising:\\n\\noperating a processor to store in memory a set of data for a geographic\\n\\nregion;\\n\\nidentifying a plurality of neighborhoods in the geographic region\\nbased on the stored set of data including determining a name for each of the\\n\\nneighborhoods;\\n\\ngenerating a boundary de\\ufb01nition for each of the neighborhoods by\\n\\nprocessing neighborhood definition infonnation in the stored set of data;\\n\\noperating the processor to assign an identi\\ufb01er to each of the\\n\\nneighborhoods;\\n\\nCreating a data structure in the memory for containing neighborhood\\n\\ndata content with at least one record for each of the neighborhoods; and\\n\\noperating the processor to populate the data structure by storing the\\nboundary de\\ufb01nition along with the associated one of the names and the\\n\\nassociated one of the identi\\ufb01ers in the records of the data structure,\\n\\nwherein the neighborhood de\\ufb01nition information comprises at least\\ntwo boundary geometries for at least one of the neighborhoods and wherein\\n\\nthe generating of the boundary de\\ufb01nition for the at least one of theAppeal 2011-004711\\nApplication 11/941,698\\nneighborhoods comprises combining the at least two boundary geometries in\\n\\nan additive manner to de\\ufb01ne a new boundary geometry.\\n\\nTHE REJECTIONS\\n\\nClaims 1, 3-12, 14, 16-18, and 20 are rejected under 35 U.S.C.\\n\\xa7 l02(a) and 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l02(e) as being anticipated by Riise (US\\n2007/0135993 Al).

See Ans. 13-1 5.\\n\\nISSUE\\nUnder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102, has the Examiner erred by concluding that\\nRiise discloses:\\n\\nwherein the neighborhood de\\ufb01nition information comprises at least\\ntwo boundary geometries for at least one ofthe neighborhoods and\\nwherein the generating of the boundary definition for the at least one\\nof the neighborhoods comprises combining the at least two boandatjz\\ngeometries in an additive manner to define a new boundary geometry\\n\\nas recited in claim 1 (emphasis added)?\\n\\nANALYSIS\\nClaims I and 9-] I\\n\\nOn this record, we find that the Examiner did not err in rejecting claim\\n\\nAppellants argue that the cited passages of Riise do not teach the\\ndisputed claim limitation. See Br. 10-12; see also Br. 7-10. Appellants\\n\\nfurther contend that Riise teaches a single geographic region (such as aAppeal 2011-004711\\n\\nApplication 1 1/941,698\\n\\nneighborhood) with a single boundary geometry that may be de\\ufb01ned using a\\npolygon and a minimum bounding rectangle, but using both a polygon and a\\n111inimum bounding rectangle does not alter the de\\ufb01nition of tl1e underlying\\nboundary geometry. See Br. 11. Appellants also contend that a minimum\\nbounding rectangle does not define a boundary. See Br. 12.\\n\\nWe disagree with Appellants\\u2019 arguments, and agree with the\\nExaminer\\u2019s conclusions. We adopt the Examiner\\u2019s reasoning and \\ufb01ndings\\nin the paragraph extending from page 18 to19 of the Answer as our own.\\nSee Ans. 18-19. As pointed out by the Examiner, Riise\\u2019s paragraph 58\\nstates:\\n\\nAlso discussed above, the minimum number of points for\\nconstructing a minimum bounding rectangle is two; however,\\nmore than two points may be used. The number of points used\\nmay directly relate to the desired accuracy of the geometric\\nshape enclosing the polygon. As the number Q/\\u2018points\\nincreases, the geometric shape more closely resembles the\\npolygon in which the shape is constructed upon. Thus, it will\\nbe appreciated that the determining processor 110 may\\nconstruct minimum bounding rectangles, but it also may\\nconstruct other geometric shapes enclosing the polygons, as\\ndiscussed above.\\n\\nRiise, 1] 58 (emphasis added).\\n\\nThe Examiner correctly maps the recited at least two boundary\\ngeometries for at least one of the neighborhoods to Riise\\u2019s points. For\\nexample, the two points for a minimum bounding rectangle constitute a\\nboundary geometry, and additional two points constitute another boundary\\ngeometry. We note that the Speci\\ufb01cation has not assigned a special meaning\\n\\nto the claim ten11 boundary geometry, and Appellants do not argue that theAppeal 2011-004711\\n\\nApplication 11/941,698\\n\\nterm has a special meaning. Therefore, the Examiner reasonably maps the\\nclaim term boundary geometry to Riise\\u2019s points.\\n\\nRiise teaches that \\u201c[a]s the number of points increases, the geometric\\nshape more closely resembles the polygon in which the shape is constructed\\nupon.\\u201d Ia\\u2019. Therefore, Riise teaches the generating of tl1e boundary\\nde\\ufb01nition for the at least one of the neighborhoods (mapped to Riise\\u2019s\\ngeometric shape more closely resembles the polygon) comprises combining\\nthe at least two boundary geometries in an additive 111anner (mapped to\\nRiise\\u2019 combining and adding the two points and the additional two points) to\\nde\\ufb01ne a new boundary geometry (mapped to Riise\\u2019s resulting four points).\\n\\nAccordingly, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1, and\\ncorresponding dependent claims 9-1 1, which Appellants do not separately\\nargue.\\n\\nClaims 3-8\\n\\nRegarding claims 3-4, Appellants have not provided any suf\\ufb01cient\\nadditional arguments (see Br. 12-13) to persuade us that the Examiner erred.\\nFurther, as discussed above with respect to claim 1, Appellants\\u2019 argument\\nthat Riise only shows a single geometry for each of its areas (Br. 13) is\\nunpersuasive. We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s conclusions, and adopt the\\nExaminer\\u2019s reasoning and findings as our own. See Ans. 22-23.\\n\\nRegarding claims 5-7, we disagree with Appellants\\u2019 arguments (Br.\\n13-14), and agree with the EXaminer\\u2019s conclusions. We adopt the\\nExaminer\\u2019s reasoning and \\ufb01ndings as our own. See Ans. 23-27. For claims\\n5-6, we note that Appellants concede that \\u201cRiise [] states that a new\\ngeographic region or polygon may be defined that is 111ade up of numerous\\n\\nexisting polygons (a number of zip code areas may be combined to create aAppeal 2011-004711\\nApplication 1 1/941,698\\nfranchise area)?\\u2019 Br. 13 (emphasis added.). Therefore, Riise teaches the\\ndisputed limitation of claim 5 because a new polygon may be defined by\\nmodifying the existing polygons with additional groups of two points.\\nRegarding claim 8, we disagree with Appellants\\u2019 arguments (Br. 14-\\n15), and agree with the EXaminer\\u2019s conclusions. We adopt the Examiner\\u2019s\\nreasoning and \\ufb01ndings as our own. See Ans. 27-28.\\nAccordingly, we do not sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1,\\n\\nand corresponding dependent clai111s 3-11.\\n\\nClaims 12, 14-18, and 20\\n\\nFor similar reasons discussed above with respect to claims 1, 5, 6, and\\n8, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 12 and 17, and\\ncorresponding dependent claims 14, 16, 18, and 20, which Appellants do not\\nseparately argue.\\n\\nRegarding claim 15, Appellants argue that claim 15 is allowable for\\nsimilar reasons as claim 12, and the additionally cited reference does not\\novercome the alleged Riise\\u2019s de\\ufb01ciencies. See Br. 15.

Appellant appeals the following rejection:  Claims 1-7 and 10-23 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112, first paragraph as failing to comply with the enablement requirement.  ISSUE \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008304 Application 11/158,370   3Did the Examiner reversibly err in concluding that independent claims 1, 14, and 16 are not enabled by the written description because they require that \\u201cthe first stacked heat conducting structure is electrically isolated from the active device\\u201d and \\u201cthe first stacked heat conducting structure is formed directly above the active device\\u201d?  We decide this issue in the affirmative.  FINDINGS OF FACT AND ANALYSES  The Examiner concludes that claims 1, 14, and 16 are not enabled by the written description because \\u201cdirectly above\\u201d in the claim requires that the first stacked heat conducting structure be in contact with the active device such that it cannot be electrically isolated from the active device (Ans. 4-8).  In that respect, the Examiner finds that there is no support for forming an oxide layer between the active device (i.e., heat source) and via 114 as shown in Figure 1A (Ans. 6).    Appellant argues that \\u201cdirectly above\\u201d does not necessarily require contact between the first stacked heat conducting structure and the active device (App. Br. 8).  Appellant contends that \\u201cdirectly above\\u201d in the context of the first stacked heat conducting structure includes embodiments where an oxide layer is formed between the active device and the first stacked heat conducting structure (App. Br. 9).  Appellant argues that the Specification at page 9, lines 18-20 describes that a given stacked heat conducting structure need not be in direct contact with the localized heat source (Reply Br. 7).    The specification, when filed, must enable one skilled in the particular art to use the invention without undue experimentation. In re Wands, 858 F.2d 731, 737 (Fed. Cir.1988).   The Examiner has not established that Appellant\\u2019s Specification would require undue experimentation to enable \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008304 Application 11/158,370   4one skilled in the art to practice the claimed invention.  Indeed, the Examiner does not make any findings or conclusions specifically with regard to whether undue experimentation would have been required to practice the claimed invention.  Rather, the Examiner is focused on whether there is \\u201cmutual support in the description\\u201d for an oxide layer between the heat source and the first via 114 (Ans. 6, 8).   The Examiner\\u2019s focus appears to be on whether there is written descriptive support rather than enablement.   We conclude that Appellant\\u2019s Specification enables one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the claimed invention.   Page 9, lines 18-19 of Specification describes that a given stacked heat conducting structure need not be in direct contact with the localized heat source (e.g., active device).  The Specification at page 10, lines 1-5, referring to Figure 3A, describes that the stacked heat conducting structure 306 includes a metallization layer trench 312 above an oxide layer overlying one or more active devices as the heat source 304.  The page 10 disclosure in the Specification further describes that \\u201calternatively\\u201d an initial via shown in phantom as element 315 may comprise an initial element of the stacked heat conducting structure 306.  Accordingly, the Specification enables having an electrically insulating layer between the active device and the first stacked heat conducting structure.    On this record and for the above reasons, we reverse the Examiner\\u2019s \\xa7 112, first paragraph, rejection for lack of enablement.     DECISION    The Examiner\\u2019s decision is reversed.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008304 Application 11/158,370   5ORDER REVERSED   tc \\x0c'},\n",

ADAMS, ERIC GRIMES, and  SHERIDAN K. SNEDDEN, Administrative Patent Judges.  ADAMS, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL1 This appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 involves claims 45-48, 50-52, 55-57, and 61-69 (App. Br. 2).  Examiner entered rejections under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112, second paragraph and 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a).2  We have jurisdiction under      35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We affirm-in-part.                                            1 The Real Party in Interest is, the inventor, Yousef Daneshvar (App. Br. 2). 2 We recognize Examiner\\u2019s designation of the obviousness rejections involving Schnipper as new grounds of rejection because Examiner rearranged the order in which the references were applied (see Ans. 4).  We are, however, not persuaded that rearranging the order in which the references were applied changed the thrust of the rejections (see MPEP  \\xa7 1207.03 III).  Therefore, notwithstanding Appellant\\u2019s failure to respond to the new ground of rejection, we considered Appellant\\u2019s arguments as set forth in Appellant\\u2019s Appeal Brief (Cf. 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.39(b)). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   2STATEMENT OF THE CASE The claims are directed to a method, system, and device for delivering medication both to an internal body cavity and to external tissue surrounding a body orifice that opens to the cavity.  Claims 45, 55, and 57 are representative and are reproduced in the Claims Appendix of Appellant\\u2019s Brief. Claims 45-48, 50-52, and 61-67 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112, second paragraph. Claims 45, 46, 52, 62, and 64-67 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Rubinstein,3 Schnipper,4 Roeder,5 and Boulanger.6 Claims 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 61, 62, and 64-67 stand rejected under  35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Groves,7 Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger.

FACTUAL FINDINGS (FF) FF 1. Examiner finds that since Appellant\\u2019s claim 45 makes reference to both a first and second impermeable layer, the recitation of the phrase \\u201cthe impermeable layer\\u201d in the fourth indented paragraph following the preamble of Appellant\\u2019s claim lacks antecedent basis (Ans. 6; see also id. at 14 (\\u201cExaminer maintains it should be clarified whether \\u2018the impermeable layer\\u2019 \\u2026 is referring to the first or second impermeable layer regardless of the order of presentation of the claims so that there can be no question as to which layer is being referred to\\u201d)). ANALYSIS  The device of Appellant\\u2019s claim 4510 comprises, inter alia, a first impermeable layer that comprises a proximal face opposite its distal face (see Appellant\\u2019s claim 45).  According to claim 45, a further layer having a distal face is disposed against the proximal face of the impermeable layer (see id.).  At this point the only impermeable layer discussed in the claim is the first impermeable layer.  Thus, as Appellant explains, at this point in the claim, the only impermeable layer that the phrase \\u201cthe impermeable layer\\u201d could refer to is the first impermeable layer (see App. Br. 10).  While claim                                            10 Claims 46-48, 50-52, and 61-67 depend directly or indirectly from claim 45. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   445 makes later reference to a second impermeable layer, we agree with Appellant that the phrase \\u201cthe impermeable layer,\\u201d in the fourth indented paragraph following the preamble of Appellant\\u2019s claim, refers to the first impermeable layer. CONCLUSION OF LAW The preponderance of evidence fails to support Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that the phrase \\u201cthe impermeable layer\\u201d lacks antecedent basis, as it appears in the fourth indented paragraph following the preamble of Appellant\\u2019s claim 45.  The rejection of claims 45-48, 50-52, and 61-67 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112, second paragraph is reversed.   Obviousness: ISSUE  Does the preponderance of evidence relied upon by Examiner support a conclusion of obviousness? FACTUAL FINDINGS (FF) FF 2. Rubinstein\\u2019s invention relates to \\u201c[a] tampon comprising a rigid conical end for entry into the cavity of a body\\u201d comprising, inter alia, \\u201ca rupturable container holding a liquid medicant,\\u201d wherein:  Immediately before or during the insertion of the tampon into the cavity of the body, the container is ruptured, releasing the liquid medicant to be absorbed by the tampon body.  After the tampon body is inserted into the cavity of the body, the tampon body expands radially about the longitudinal axis thereof from the absorption of the liquid medicant.  The lips of the cavity of the body grasp the neck of the tampon body and the expanded tampon body engage[s] the walls surrounding the cavity of the body inwardly of the lips for inhibiting unintentional expelling of the tampon from the cavity of the body and for providing \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   5direct contact between the medicated tampon body and the walls surrounding the cavity of the body.  (Rubinstein, Abstract; see also Ans. 6.) FF 3. Rubinstein suggests that \\u201c[a]lthough [the device] \\u2026 is intended primarily for rectal use in the care of hemorrhoids and rectal fistula, it may also be used to [an] advantage in other body cavities, such as the vagina, uterus, external auditory canal, etc.\\u201d  (Id. at col. 1, ll. 18-22.) FF 4. Rubinstein\\u2019s Figure 3 is reproduced below:     \\u201cFIG. 3 is a longitudinal sectional view of \\u2026 [Rubinstein\\u2019s] tampon [10] \\u2026 before the container [30] holding medicant, which is disposed in the tampon body [20], has been ruptured\\u201d (id. at col. 3, ll. 30-33). FF 5. Rubinstein suggests that \\u201c[t]he absorbent portion 45a of the protector 45 becomes moistened with medicant through the absorbent material of the neck portion 20b, thus providing contact with external hemorrhoids should any be present\\u201d (id. at col. 5, ll. 48-50; see also Ans. 6-7). FF 6. Rubinstein suggests that \\u201cdisc protector 45 comprises an absorbent portion 45a made of cotton or other suitable absorbent material and an impervious[, or impermeable,] portion 45b made of plastic or other suitable impervious material\\u201d and \\u201c[t]he absorbent portion 45a faces the body cavity \\u2026 to protect the user from escaping substances to reduce the soiling of clothes or the like\\u201d (id. at col. 4, ll. 63 - col. 5, l. 3; see also Ans. 7 (Rubinstein\\u2019s device comprises \\u201ca first impermeable layer [45b,] which \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   6comprises a distal face disposed against the proximal face of the pad [45a], the first impermeable layer further comprising a proximal face opposite its distal face\\u201d)). FF 7. Examiner finds that Rubinstein does \\u201cnot disclose a further absorbent layer and a second impermeable layer\\u201d (Ans. 7). FF 8. Schnipper suggests a medicated pad, applicable for the treatment of hemorrhoids, comprising an \\u201cimpermeable layer between the anaesthetic gel [medication] and the napkin [to] prevent the absorption of the former on the latter\\u201d (Schnipper, Abstract and col. 1, ll. 66-67; see also Ans. 7). FF 9. Schnipper\\u2019s Figure 2 is reproduced below:    FIG. 2 is a sectional view of Schnipper\\u2019s sanitary napkin (see id. at col. 2, ll. 14-15). FF 10. Schnipper\\u2019s napkin comprises: (1) a tubular sheath 10 whose central portion 12 is filled with an absorbent material 112, wherein both the sheath 10 and the filling 112 are made from materials, such as gauze and cotton-wool respectively and (2) a generally rectangular patch of impermeable material 20 secured to one face of the sheath 10 near one end of the central portion 12, wherein the material of \\u201clayer 20 is impermeable to, and unaffected by, the medicated gel 30 overlaying same\\u201d (id. col. 2, ll. 25-40). FF 11. In use, Schnipper\\u2019s napkin  [P]ermits the mutually contradictory purposes of the absorbent filling 112 of the napkin and of the gel layer 30 to be achieved; the napkin is available to absorb the vaginal discharge, and is prevented from absorbing the medicated gel by the interposition \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   7of the impermeable layer 20; at the same time the gel 30 and its supporting layer 20 insulate the wound region from the chafing action of the sanitary pad and from contact with, the possibly irritating discharge. (Id. at col. 3, ll. 24-33; see Ans. 7.) FF 12. Examiner finds that while Schnipper suggests securing the device with a sanitary belt, Roeder suggests the attachment of sanitary napkins to a wearer\\u2019s garment through the use of an adhesive (Ans. 7; see also Roeder, col. 1, ll. 10-19 (\\u201csanitary napkins with adhesive attachment means \\u2026 due to obvious advantages of convenience and comfort have almost universally supplanted \\u2026 belted napkins\\u201d); see also Roeder, col. 2, ll. 6-12). FF 13. Examiner relies on Boulanger to suggest that the use of \\u201can impermeable layer \\u2026 below the absorbent core [of a sanitary absorbent article that is attached to an undergarment] to prevent liquid collected in the absorbent core f[rom] soiling the undergarment\\u201d (Ans. 7). FF 14. Examiner finds that Groves suggests \\u201ca device for delivering medication both to an internal body cavity and to external tissue surrounding a body orifice that opens to the cavity,\\u201d but fails to suggest \\u201ca first impermeable layer, a further absorbent layer, and a second impermeable layer\\u201d (Ans. 8-9; see also Final Rej. 9 (\\u201cGroves teaches a device for treatment of hemorrhoids with and [sic] elongated body and a medicated pad for treatment of an internal body cavity and the tissue surrounding the orifice\\u201d); Groves, col. 3, ll. 32-67). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   8FF 15. Groves Figure 11 is reproduced below:   \\u201cFIG. 11 depicts a suppository with cotton spun at each end with the outermost portion of one bulb uncoated for the purpose of absorbing excess dissolved medicaments,\\u201d which are \\u201clocated between the bulb-like structures 82 and 83\\u201d (Groves, col. 2, ll. 54-57 and col. 6, ll. 34-36). FF 16. Examiner finds that the combination of Schnipper and Groves fails to suggest a device having an elongate body comprising \\u201ca balloon that can be expanded after placement in the body\\u201d (Ans. 11). FF 17. Examiner finds that Wilk suggests \\u201ca device for treatment of hemorrhoids \\u2026 in which the body is expandable to maintain direct contact with the hemorrhoidal tissue\\u201d (id.). FF 18. Examiner finds that Groves suggests a system and method of delivering a medication both to an internal body cavity through a natural body orifice that opens to the cavity and to external tissue surrounding the orifice as set forth in Appellant\\u2019s claims 55-57, 68, and 69; with the exception of the manner in which the medicament is applied to the device (see id. at 11-12; see also FF 14-15). FF 19. Examiner relies on Mulholland to suggest \\u201cforming the medicament portion of a suppository device using insert molding \\u2026 in which the base of the device is placed into a mold which contains the medicament\\u201d (id. at 12-13; see Mulholland 7: \\xb6\\xb6 [0119]-[0120] (Mulholland suggests placing a suppository device into a mold and injecting a melted medicament composition into the mold to coat the desired portions of the device)). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   9ANALYSIS The combination of Rubinstein, Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger: Based on the combination of Rubinstein, Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger, Examiner concludes that, at the time Appellant\\u2019s invention was made, it would have been prima facie obvious to substitute the external pad 45a portion of Rubinstein\\u2019s device, with a pad suggested by the combination of Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger, which would (1) adhesively affix the pad to a user\\u2019s undergarment to provide \\u201cmedication to the external hemorrhoid and \\u2026 [(2) have] the additional benefit of absorbing discharge from the patient\\u201d (see Ans. 7-8 and 14-15).  We are not persuaded.   Rubinstein\\u2019s device treats both internal and external body portions (FF 2-6).  The external treating portion of Rubinstein\\u2019s device comprises a medicated portion 45a and an impermeable portion 45b which prevents soiling of a user\\u2019s undergarment (FF 2 and 6).  Rubinstein suggests that, in use, the structure of the device itself inhibits \\u201cunintentional expelling of the tampon from the cavity of the body\\u201d (FF 6).  In sum, Examiner failed to articulate how a person of ordinary skill in this art would have modified Rubinstein\\u2019s device as proposed by Examiner, for example, to prevent the absorption of medicament into a pad such as that suggested by Schnipper and thereby require an additional medicament area, and corresponding impermeable layer, as suggested by Schnipper (see FF 2-6; Cf. FF 8-11).  \\u201c[R]ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere conclusory statements; instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness.\\u201d  In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   10The combination of Groves, Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger: Claims 45, 62, and 64: Based on the combination of Groves, Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger, Examiner concludes that, at the time Appellant\\u2019s invention was made, it would have been prima facie obvious to modify external absorbent bulb portion 83 of Groves\\u2019 elongated body to include a medicated pad as suggested by Schnipper, which comprises an impermeable layer adhered to a portion of the body facing side of the pad, and place a second impermeable layer on the undergarment facing side of Schnipper\\u2019s pad to \\u201cprevent liquid collected in the absorbent core f[rom] soiling the undergarment\\u201d as suggested by Boulanger (see Final Rej. 9; FF 8-11 and 13-15).  We agree with Examiner that the foregoing combination would provide a user the benefit of a medicated treatment to both the interior and exterior portion of the body, while preventing soiling of the user\\u2019s undergarment (see generally Final Rej. 9-10).  In addition, we find no error in Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that, at the time of Appellant\\u2019s claimed invention, it would have been prima facie obvious to cover the entire device, or the medicated portions thereof, prior to use to prevent contamination (Ans. 10; Cf. Appellant\\u2019s claims 62 and 64). For the foregoing reasons, we are not persuaded by Appellant\\u2019s contention that \\u201cGroves is merely cumulative to Rubenstein, and the rejection \\u2026 is in error for the same reasons explained above\\u201d (App. Br. 12).    Claims 47, 48, and 61:  Claims 47, 48, and 61 depend directly or indirectly from claim 46.  Claim 46 is not included in this ground of rejection.  Therefore, Examiner \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   11failed to establish an evidentiary basis on this record to support a conclusion that the subject matter of claims 47, 48, and 61 is made obvious by the combination of Groves, Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger.  The combination of Groves, Schnipper, Roeder, Boulanger, and Wilk: Based on the combination of Groves, Schnipper, Roeder, Boulanger, and Wilk, Examiner concludes that, at the time Appellant\\u2019s invention was made, it would have been prima facie obvious to modify the elongated body of the device suggested by the combination of Groves and Schnipper to include an expandable body \\u201cbecause Wilk teaches this to be beneficial as it allows for the elongated body to maintain direct contact with the hemorrhoidal tissue\\u201d (Ans. 11).   Having found no deficiency in the combination of Groves, Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger we are not persuaded by Appellant\\u2019s contention \\u201cthat this rejection should not be sustained for the same reasons\\u201d Appellant provided against the combination of Groves, Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger (App. Br. 13).  The combination of Groves and Mulholland:   Based on the combination of Groves and Mulholland, Examiner concludes that, at the time Appellant\\u2019s invention was made, it would have been prima facie obvious: [T]o shape the mold[, suggested by Mulholland,] to correspond with the shape of the device in Groves with a first cylindrical walled portion to accommodate the elongated body and a second portion of a greater diameter to accommodate the pad so as to properly apply medication to the device of Groves which matches the shape of the device.  Further, it would have been \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   12obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to use a removable cover on the mold receptacle to maintain sterility. (Ans. 12 and 13.)  We find no error in Examiner\\u2019s prima facie case of obviousness.  To the extent that Examiner\\u2019s rationale reverses the order of steps of Appellant\\u2019s claimed method, we find that reversing the order of process steps is prima facie obvious in the absence of new or unexpected results.  In re Burhans, 154 F.2d 690, 692 (CCPA 1946).  Claims 55 and 68:  Appellant contends that the \\u201crejection is an unsupported assertion that the claimed subject matter \\u2026 would have been obvious, simply because of the shape of the delivery device.  That assertion is submitted not to provide prima facie factual support for [the] rejection\\u201d (App. Br. 13).  We are not persuaded by Appellant\\u2019s conclusory statement, which fails to explain why the combination of references relied upon by Examiner fails to suggest the claimed subject matter.  Claim 68:  For the reasons set forth above, we are not persuaded by Appellant\\u2019s conclusory statement (see App. Br. 13).  We recognize, but are not persuaded by, Appellant\\u2019s intimation that Examiner failed to account for the \\u201ccertain fill level\\u201d requirements of Appellant\\u2019s claim 68 (id.).  As Examiner explains, \\u201cwhen a solid is placed in a liquid the liquid is naturally always displaced by the solid and as such further medication surrounds the device.  The Examiner maintains that one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to create a mold to the desired shape of the delivery device being used\\u201d and \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   13thereby deliver medication to the device as necessary (Ans. 15).  We find no error in Examiner\\u2019s prima facie case.  Claim 57:  Appellant contends that Mulholland\\u2019s molding method \\u201cis not immersion\\u201d as is required by claim 57 (App. Br. 13 (emphasis removed)). We are not persuaded.  Mulholland suggests a method of coating a device with medication (FF 19).  Therefore, we find Mulholland makes obvious the application of medication to a device, whether (a) the device is inserted into a container holding medicament or (b) the medicament is inserted into a container holding the device.  As Examiner explains, Appellant\\u2019s claim fails to include \\u201cspecific recitations \\u2026 which distinguish an immersion method per se from a molding method\\u201d (Ans. 15).  See Burhans, 154 F.2d at 692.  CONCLUSION OF LAW The preponderance of evidence relied upon by Examiner fails to support a conclusion of obviousness with regard to the following rejections:   - The rejection of claims 45, 46, 52, 62, and 64-67 under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Rubinstein, Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger is reversed. - The rejection of claims 47, 48, and 61 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Groves, Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger is reversed.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-001972 Application 11/731,945   14The preponderance of evidence relied upon by Examiner supports a conclusion of obviousness with regard to the following rejections: - The rejection of claims 45, 62, and 64 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Groves, Schnipper, Roeder, and Boulanger is affirmed.  Claims 50, 51, and 65-67 fall with claim 45.  Because our reasoning differs from Examiner\\u2019s we designate our affirmance as a new ground of rejection. - The rejection of claim 63 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Groves, Schnipper, Roeder, Boulanger, and Wilk is affirmed.  Because our reasoning differs from Examiner\\u2019s we designate our affirmance as a new ground of rejection. - The rejection of claims 55, 57, and 68 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Groves and Mulholland is affirmed.  Claim 56 falls with claim 55 and claim 69 falls with claim 57.

Submit an appropriate amendment of the claims so rejected or new evidence relating to the claims so rejected, or both, and have the matter reconsidered by the examiner, in which event the proceeding will be remanded to the examiner\\u2026.  (2) Request rehearing.  Request that the proceeding be reheard under \\xa7 41.52 by the Board upon the same record\\u2026.  Should the Appellant elect to prosecute further before the Examiner pursuant to 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.50(b)(1), in order to preserve the right to seek review under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7\\xa7 141 or 145 with respect to the affirmed rejection, the effective date of the affirmance is deferred until conclusion of the prosecution before the Examiner unless, as a mere incident to the limited prosecution, the affirmed rejection is overcome.  If the Appellant elects prosecution before the Examiner and this does not result in allowance of the application, abandonment or a second appeal, this case should be returned to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board for final action on the affirmed rejection, including any timely request for rehearing thereof.

DECISION ON APPEAL\\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009099 Reexamination Control 95/001,581 Patent 7,777,651 B2  2   This proceeding arose from a third party request on behalf of CME Group, Inc., New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., and Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. for an inter partes reexamination of U. S. Patent 7,777,651 B2 (the \\u2019651 patent), entitled \\u201cSystem and Method for Data Feed Acceleration and Encryption,\\u201d assigned to Realtime Data LLC and issued to James J. Fallon, Paul F. Pickel, Stephen J. McErlain, and Carlton W. Melone (August 17, 2010).  The Examiner refuses to adopt the proposed rejections of claims 1-123.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7\\xa7 134 and 306.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE The \\u2019651 patent describes transmission of broadcast data over a communication channel using data compression and decompression (col. 6, ll. 8-11). Claim 1 on appeal reads as follows: 1. A method of decoding one or more encoded messages of a data packet in a financial data stream using a data decoding engine, wherein multiple decoders applying a plurality of lossless decompression techniques are applied to an encoded message, the method comprising: receiving an encoded message in a data packet of the financial data stream having a plurality of data fields associated with the encoded message and one or more descriptors comprising one or more values, wherein the one or more descriptors indicate data field types of the data fields and lossless encoders used to encode the data fields, and further wherein the lossless encoders are selected based on analyses of content of the data fields; analyzing the encoded message to identify a descriptor; selecting one or more lossless decoders for a data field associated with the encoded message, wherein the selecting is based on the descriptor and a description file, and further wherein the description file comprises data field types and associated lossless decoders; decoding the data field with a selected lossless decoder utilizing content dependent data decompression, if the descriptor indicates the data field is encoded utilizing content dependent data compression; and \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009099 Reexamination Control 95/001,581 Patent 7,777,651 B2  3  decoding the data field with a selected lossless decoder utilizing content independent data decompression, if the descriptor indicates the data field is encoded utilizing content independent data compression.

Claims 1, 13, 22, 29, 43, 52, 60, 73, 91, 98, 108, and 115 recite lossless decompression techniques. Requester argues that XMill discloses \\u201czlib\\u201d and \\u201cgzip,\\u201d both of which are lossless decompression techniques (3PR App. Br. 9, citing Requester Comments filed October 26, 2011 (\\u201c3PR Comments\\u201d) at 9 and Declaration of Paul C. Clark dated October 26, 2011 (\\u201cClark Declaration\\u201d), \\xb6 30).  In addition, Requester argues that XML explicitly discloses lossless decompression techniques (3PR App. Br. 9).  The Examiner does not adequately refute either the testimony of Paul C. Clark that XMill discloses \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009099 Reexamination Control 95/001,581 Patent 7,777,651 B2  7  lossless decompression techniques or the disclosure of lossless decompression techniques by XML. With respect to claims 1-12, the Examiner also finds that XMill fails to disclose data fields associated with the encoded message or descriptors that indicate data field types of the data fields and lossless encoders used to encode the data fields as recited in claim 1 (ACP 6-7, citing NF OA, p. 13).  Claim 1 recites descriptors that indicate data field types of the data fields and lossless encoder used to encode the data fields. Requester argues that XMill discloses data fields (e.g., \\u201clog files\\u201d in which \\u201c[e]ach line is a record with eleven fields\\u201d \\u2013 3PR App. Br. 8, citing XMill at 3-4).  Requester also argues that XMill discloses a descriptor that indicates data field types and encoders used to encode the data fields (e.g., \\u201cassigning [an] XML tag to each field\\u201d \\u2013 3PR App. Br. 8, citing XMill at 4; \\u201cXMill applies different specialized compressors . . . to different containers\\u201d \\u2013 3PR App. Br. 8, citing XMill at 2).  The Examiner and Patent Owner does not adequately refute Requester\\u2019s showing of the disclosure in XMill of either data fields or descriptors that indicate data field types and encoders used to encode data fields. With respect to claims 1-12, the Examiner also finds that XMill fails to disclose selecting based on a descriptor and a description file (ACP 6-7, citing OA2, p. 10).  Claim 1 recites selecting a decoder based on the descriptor and a description file. As noted above, Requester argues that XMill discloses specialized compressors for compressing specific types of data (e.g., \\u201cXML tag\\u201d assigned to each field and \\u201csome data items are text, others are numbers, while others may be DNA sequences.  XMill applies different specialized \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009099 Reexamination Control 95/001,581 Patent 7,777,651 B2  8  compressors (semantic compressors) to different containers\\u201d \\u2013 3PR App. Br. 8).  XMill also discloses that the data items that are compressed are also decompressed (e.g., XMill describes \\u201ca compressor (XMill) and decompressor (XDemill),\\u201d at 1).  The Examiner or Patent Owner does not adequately refute the Requester\\u2019s showing that XMill discloses descriptors (e.g., tags) that indicate encoders (e.g., semantic compressors) for encoding data and selecting a decoder (e.g., according to a corresponding semantic compressor) or how such a disclosure differs from the disputed claim features. With respect to claims 22-51, the Examiner finds that XMill fails to disclose an encoded data packet, data block, data block type, computer file, and descriptor as recited in claim 22 (ACP 15, 17, 20, citing NF OA, p. 61, 84, 105).  Claims 22, 29, and 43 recite an encoded data packet, applying compression techniques to data blocks, determining a data block type, a computer file that indicates data block types and encoders, and a descriptor that indicates an encoder.  With respect to a data packet, Requester argues that XMill discloses data in a container (e.g., a \\u201cdecompressor parses the structure container . . . for the data items\\u201d or \\u201c[d]ata items are grouped into containers\\u201d \\u2013 Requester for Inter Partes Reexamination, dated March 21, 2011 (\\u201cRequest\\u201d) at 78 and 81).  The Examiner does not adequately demonstrate a difference between the \\u201ccontainer\\u201d of XMill and the \\u201cdata packet\\u201d as claimed. With respect to a descriptor that indicates an encoder, Requester argues that XMill discloses parsing \\u201cthe structure container [to invoke] the corresponding semantic decompressor for the data items\\u201d (Request 81, citing XMill at 9).  Hence, XMill discloses a \\u201cdescriptor\\u201d (i.e., data that is parsed \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009099 Reexamination Control 95/001,581 Patent 7,777,651 B2  9  in a container (or data packet)) that indicates an encoder (i.e., based on the parsed data, a corresponding decompressor is selected).  The Examiner does not adequately demonstrate a difference between the data parsed to determine a corresponding decompressor of XMill and the \\u201cdescriptor\\u201d as recited in the disputed claims. With respect to a data block, the Requester argues that XMill discloses compressing \\u201cheterogeneous XML data\\u201d (Request 92, citing XMill at 1).  Both the data of XMill and the \\u201cdata blocks\\u201d as recited in the disputed claims are compressed.  The Examiner does not adequately demonstrate a difference between the data of XMill and the \\u201cdata blocks\\u201d as recited in, for example, claim 22. With respect to a \\u201ccomputer file\\u201d and a data block type, the Requester argues that XMill discloses a \\u201ccompression processor\\u201d that \\u201ccomprises computer readable program code of instructions\\u201d (i.e., \\u201cimplemented in C++\\u201d) that \\u201canalyzes the content of the data block to determine a data block type\\u201d (e.g., the processor of XMill groups \\u201cdata items\\u201d into \\u201ccontainers\\u201d; the data is of a specific type \\u2013 or \\u201cdata block type\\u201d \\u2013 e.g., \\u201ctext, . . . numbers, . . . DNA sequences\\u201d \\u2013 Request 95, citing XMill 2 and 14).  The Examiner does not adequately demonstrate a difference between the computer readable program code of instructions of XMill that specifies a type of data (e.g., text, numbers, or DNA sequences) and the computer file as recited in the disputed claims, the claimed computer file indicating a data block type.  The Examiner also does not adequately demonstrate a difference between the type of data in the data \\u201ccontainers\\u201d of XMill and the data block type, as recited in the disputed claims.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009099 Reexamination Control 95/001,581 Patent 7,777,651 B2  10  The Examiner provides similar findings for similar reasons for claims 52-59 (ACP 22, citing NF OA p. 124), 60-72 (ACP 24, citing NF OA, p. 145), 73-114 (ACP 27, 30, 33, 36, citing NF OA, p. 168, 192, 211, 235), and claims 115-123 (ACP 37, citing NF OA, p. 253).  We are not persuaded by the Examiner\\u2019s findings for at least the reasons set forth above. The Examiner states that XMill fails to disclose providing one or more global state machines and one or more adaptive local state machines (ACP 15, 17, 20, 24, 27, 33).  Claim 7, for example, recites global state machines and adaptive local state machines.  The Requester argues that XMill discloses this feature (e.g., maintaining \\u201ca state between the (de)compression of single text values \\u2013 Request 157, citing XMill at 17 \\u2013 and a \\u201cplurality of tables\\u201d as \\u201cstate machines \\u2013 id., citing XMill at 14) and that Reynar also discloses this feature (e.g., a \\u201cpre-filled dictionary\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201cglobal table\\u201d \\u2013 and a data specific or adaptive dictionary \\u2013 or \\u201cadaptive local table\\u201d \\u2013 Request 157, citing Reynar, col. 13, ll. 57-62).  The Examiner does not adequately demonstrate a difference between, for example, the plurality of tables of XMill or the \\u201cpre-filled dictionary\\u201d of Reynar and the claimed \\u201cglobal state machine.\\u201d  The Examiner also does not adequately demonstrate a difference between, for example, a data specific or adaptive dictionary of Reynar and the claimed \\u201cadaptive local state machines.\\u201d   With respect to claims 33 and 79, the Examiner states that XMill fails to disclose that the encoded data packet is a UDP data packet (ACP 18, 20, 27).  Claim 33, for example, recites that the encode data packet is a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) data packet.  The Requester argues that Birdwell discloses \\u201can uncompressed packet header of a UDP/IP data packet to be transmitted over a broadcast medium\\u201d (Request 283, citing Birdwell, claim \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009099 Reexamination Control 95/001,581 Patent 7,777,651 B2  11  15).  The Examiner does not adequately demonstrate a difference between the UDP data packet of Birdwell and the UDP packet recited in claim 33, for example.  Reversal of the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt the proposed rejections of claims 1-123, over the combination of XMill, XML, Zusman, alone or in combination with one of Reynar or Birdwell, renders it unnecessary to reach the propriety of the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt proposed rejections of those claims on a different basis.  Cf. In re Gleave, 560 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  As such, we need not reach the propriety of the Examiner\\u2019s refusal to adopt the proposed rejections of those claims over Danskin, Sebastian, Carr, Hauck, XML, Reynar, or Franaszek, alone or in combination with any of Zusman, Birdwell, Bhandari, Giltner, RFC1662, or Langdon.   DECISION We reverse the Examiner\\u2019s decision not to reject claims 1-6, 10-12, 22-25, 29-32, 34, 38-42, 60-63, 67-78, 80, 84-90, 98-102, 106, and 107 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XMill, XML, and Zusman; claims 7-9, 13-21, 26-28, 35-37, 43-59, 64-66, 81-83, 91-97, 103-105, 108-123 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XMill, XML, Zusman, and Reynar; and claims 33 and 79 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over XMill, XML, Zusman, and Birdwell. Pursuant to 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.77(a), the above-noted reversal constitutes a new ground of rejection.  Section 41.77(b) provides that \\u201c[a] new ground of rejection . . . shall not be considered final for judicial review.\\u201d  That section also provides that Patent Owner, WITHIN ONE MONTH FROM THE DATE OF THE DECISION, must exercise one of the following two \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009099 Reexamination Control 95/001,581 Patent 7,777,651 B2  12  options with respect to the new grounds of rejection to avoid termination of the appeal proceeding as to the rejected claims: (1) Reopen prosecution. The owner may file a response requesting reopening of prosecution before the examiner.  Such a response must be either an amendment of the claims so rejected or new evidence relating to the claims so rejected, or both.           (2) Request rehearing.  The owner may request that the proceeding be reheard under \\xa7 41.79 by the Board upon the same record.  The request for rehearing must address any new ground of rejection and state with particularity the points believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked in entering the new ground of rejection and also state all other grounds upon which rehearing is sought.  In accordance with 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.79(a)(1), the \\u201c[p]arties to the appeal may file a request for rehearing of the decision within one month of the date of: . . .

EVANS, and  JENNIFER M. MEYER, Administrative Patent Judges.  EVANS, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL  This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) involving claims to a processor configured to operate with multiple operation codes.  The Examiner has rejected the claims as obvious.  We have jurisdiction under  35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We reverse.   Rather than reiterate the arguments of Appellants and the Examiner,                                            1 The real party in interest is LSI Corporation. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006862 Application 11/755,511  2 we refer to the Appeal Brief (filed Oct. 18, 2010), the Answer (mailed Dec. 29, 2010), and the Reply Brief (filed Feb. 28, 2011).  STATEMENT OF THE CASE  The claims relate to a processor configured to operate with multiple operation codes for each of a plurality of instructions.  The processor comprises memory circuitry and processing circuitry coupled to the memory circuitry.  The processing circuitry is configured to decode a first operation code to produce a given one of the instructions and to decode a second operation code different than the first operation code to also produce the given instruction.  Thus, the same instruction is produced for execution by the processing circuitry regardless of whether the first operation code or the second operation code is decoded.  The assignment of multiple operation codes to a given instruction may occur in conjunction with the design of the processor, and dynamic selection of a particular one of those operation codes may be performed in conjunction with assembly of code for execution by the processor.  Abstract. Claims 1-8 and 24-35 are on appeal.  Claims 1, 25, and 29 are independent.  App. Br. 2.  An understanding of the invention can be derived from a reading of exemplary claim 1, which is reproduced below: 1. A processor comprising:  memory circuitry; and  processing circuitry coupled to the memory circuitry and configured to retrieve operation codes from the memory circuitry and to decode said operation codes to produce corresponding instructions for execution by the processing circuitry;  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006862 Application 11/755,511  3 wherein the processing circuitry is configured to decode a first operation code to produce a given one of the instructions and to decode a second operation code different than the first operation code to also produce the given one of the instructions, that same instruction thereby being produced for execution by the processing circuitry regardless of whether the first operation code or the second operation code is decoded;  wherein the first and second operation codes each correspond only to the given one of the instructions.  The claims stand rejected as follows: 1. Claims 1-3, 6-8, 24, 25, 28-30, and 33-35 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Mills2 and Subramanyan3.  (Ans. 4-7).  2. Claims 4, 5, 26, 27, 31, and 32 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Mills, Subramanyan, and Kobayashi4.  (Ans. 7-9).  THE SUBRAMANYAN REFERENCE  The Federal Circuit reviews the Board\\u2019s factual determinations for substantial evidence, In re Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2000), and the Board\\u2019s legal conclusions de novo, In re Klopfenstein, 380 F.3d 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  \\u201cWhether an asserted anticipatory document qualifies as a \\u2018printed publication\\u2019 is a legal conclusion based on underlying factual determinations.\\u201d  In re Lister, 92 USPQ2d 1225, 2009-1060, slip op.                                            2 Mills, US 5,721,945, Feb. 24, 1998. 3 The provenance of Subramanyan will be discussed in the body of the opinion. 4 Kobayashi, US 4,774,688, Sep. 27, 1988. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006862 Application 11/755,511  4 5 (Fed. Cir. 2009)(quoting Cooper Cameron Corp. v. Kvaerner Oilfield Prods., Inc., 291 F.3d 1317, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  All claims appealed in the action stand rejected over the combination of, at least, Mills and Subramanyan.  (Ans. 4, 7).  We first review the Subramanyan reference to determine whether it qualifies as a reference under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102. The Examiner cites the Subramanyan reference as: Subramanyan, \\u201cProcessors, Chapter 6, Operand Addressing and Instruction Representation\\u201d, 2005, pp 1-23.  (Ans. 3; PTO-8925).  The Examiner characterizes the Subramanyan slide presentation as \\u201ca copy of lecture notes from 2005 for a CS250 class.\\u201d  (Ans. 4).  This lack of bibliographic specificity prompts the question whether the Subramanyan reference was \\u201c\\u2018sufficiently accessible to the public interested in the art\\u2019\\u201d so as \\u201cto qualify as a printed publication within the meaning of \\xa7102.\\u201d  Lister, at 1227; In re Cronyn, 890 F.2d 1158, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1989)(quoting Constant v. Adv. Micro-Devices, Inc., 848 F.2d 1560, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). A reference is considered publicly accessible if it was \\u201cdisseminated or otherwise made available to the extent that persons interested and ordinarily skilled in the subject matter or art exercising reasonable diligence, can locate it.\\u201d  Lister, at id. (quoting Kyocera Wireless Corp. v. Int\\u2019l Trade Comm\\u2019n, 545 F.3d 1340, 1350 (2008)).  Whether a reference is publicly accessible is determined on a case-by-case basis based on the \\u201cfacts and circumstances surrounding the reference\\u2019s disclosure to members of the                                            5 Notice of References Cited, PTO-892, mailed 12/14/2009. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006862 Application 11/755,511  5 public.\\u201d  Lister at 1227 (quoting Klopfenstein, 380 F.3d at 1350 (listing four factors relevant to whether a slide presentation was a printed publication)).  The record does not show that the Subramanyan reference was publically displayed more than a year prior to the filing of Appellants\\u2019 application.6  Moreover, on the record before us, none of the four Klopfenstein factors are present to suggest that the Subramanyan slide presentation qualifies as a printed publication.7  Nor does the record suggest the Subramanyan reference was indexed or cataloged in a \\u201c\\u2018meaningful way that would permit a researcher to locate it.\\u201d  Lister, at 1230.  Appellants have not raised the issue of the qualification of Subramanyan as a reference.  \\u201cThe Board will generally not reach the merits of any issues not contested by an appellant.\\u201d  (Ex parte Frye, 94 USPQ2d 1072, 1075 (BPAI 2010) (precedential); Hyatt v. Dudas, 551 F.3d 1307,                                            6 Subramanyan displays an indicia \\u201c2005,\\u201d but without indicating its significance.  A Google\\xae search of the term \\u201cSubramanyan Operand Addressing\\u201d returned two  hits (on the first page of 2.1 million pages) for the Subramanyan document: the undated document, itself, and a \\u201cCourse Hero\\u201d listing of a Peurdue CS 250 course dated \\u201cFall 2008.\\u201d  The  Google\\xae search of the title \\u201cProcessors, Chapter 6, Operand Addressing and Instruction Representation\\u201d does provide a URL, http://www.eca.cs.purdue.edu/CS250/ir/lec/Chap6.pdf, that produced the document with the front page displaying the year 2005.  However, it is unclear as to when this URL became publicly available in this printed format after the actual presentation.   7 \\u201cThe factors relevant to the facts of this case are: the length of time the display was exhibited, the expertise of the target audience, the existence (or lack thereof) of reasonable expectations that the material displayed would not be copied, and the simplicity or ease with which the material displayed could have been copied.\\u201d  In re Klopfenstein, 380 F.3d 1345, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006862 Application 11/755,511  6 1313-14 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (the Board may treat arguments appellant failed to make for a given ground of rejection as waived)).  The Frye doctrine is one of general applicability which does not preclude the Board from raising an issue sua sponte.  In the present appeal, the Board lacks a sufficient factual basis to draw the legal conclusion, and to so certify to our reviewing court, that the Subramanyan document qualifies as a printed publication.  (Lister, id. at 5).  In view of the foregoing, we find Subramanyan to be not qualified as a reference against the present application. OBVIOUSNESS  Because each claim stands rejected over the combination of, at least, Mills and Subramanyan (Ans. 4, 7) and because we find that Subramanyan does not qualify as a reference, we find the prima facie case is not made.    ORDER The rejection of claims 1-8 and 24-35 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103 is REVERSED.   REVERSED   gvw   \\x0c'},\n",

[0001]).   10 An understanding of the invention can be derived from a reading of 11 exemplary claims 8 and 35, which are reproduced below. 12 8. A method for playing a multi-line card game comprising: 13 providing an array of cards arranged in columns and rows; 14 providing a plurality of paylines; 15 selecting two cards of the array of cards, wherein the two 16 selected cards are swapped if one or more winning 17 combinations are to occur upon swapping, and are kept in place 18 if no winning combination can occur upon swapping; 19 setting, prior to swapping, a cost directly associated with the 20 swapping to allow wagering on the swapping;  21 each time one or more winning combinations are obtained, 22 removing cards involved in the one or more winning 23 combinations, thus forming voids in the array, the cards 24                                                             1 Our decision will make reference to the Appellant\\u2019s Appeal Brief (\\u201cApp. Br.,\\u201d filed March 28, 2011) and the Examiner\\u2019s Answer (\\u201cAns.,\\u201d mailed June 10, 2011). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013258 Application 12/058,578  3  involved in the one or more winning combinations being the 1 only cards removed; and 2 filling the voids in the array by automatic dealing of new cards. 3  4 35. A method for playing a multi-line card game comprising: 5 providing an array of cards arranged in columns and rows; 6 providing a plurality of paylines; 7 selecting, prior to playing, a cost associated with the playing to 8 allow playing the multiline card game; 9 selecting two cards of the array of cards, wherein the two 10 selected cards are swapped if one or more winning 11 combinations are to occur upon swapping, and are kept in place 12 if no winning combination can occur upon swapping; 13 setting, prior to swapping, a cost associated with the swapping 14 to allow wagering on the swapping, wherein the cost associated 15 with the swapping is independent of the cost associated with the 16 playing; 17 each time one or more winning combinations are obtained, 18 removing cards involved in the one or more winning 19 combinations, thus forming voids in the array, the cards 20 involved in the one or more winning combinations being the 21 only cards removed; and 22 filling the voids in the array by automatic dealing of new cards. 23 REFERENCES 24 The Examiner relies upon the following as evidence of unpatentability: 25 Prerost  US 5,407,209   Apr. 18, 1995 26 Pacey  US 2004/0033829 A1  Feb. 19, 2004 27 REJECTIONS ON APPEAL 28 The following rejections are before us for review: 29 1. Claims 4, 5, 7-13, and 35 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 101 as 30 directed to non-statutory subject matter. 31 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013258 Application 12/058,578  4  2.

Quigg, 849 F.2d 1422, 1427 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (explaining the 6 general evidentiary standard for proceedings before the Office). 7 Facts relating to the prior art 8 Pacey 9 FF1.  Pacey discloses that video gaming machines are typically operable 10 to play such traditional games as slots, poker, bingo, keno, and blackjack.  11 Pacey, para. [0003].  12 FF2.  Pacey discloses a first embodiment where a video gaming machine 13 receives a wager from a player who then selects pairs of symbols from a 14 filled array that when swapped (exchanged), create predefined, award-15 generating symbol combinations.  Pacey, para. [0018]. FF3.  Pacey discloses 16 a second embodiment where a video gaming machine receives a wager from 17 a player, and then automatically selects any pairs of symbols from a filled 18 array that create predefined, winning combinations of symbols.  Pacey, para. 19 [0030].  FF4.  Pacey discloses a video gaming machine where the first 20 embodiment may be added to the second embodiment.  Pacey, para. [0035]. 21 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013258 Application 12/058,578  5  ANALYSIS 1 The rejection of claims 4, 5, 7-13 and 35 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 101 as 2 directed to non-statutory subject matter. 3 We are not persuaded by the Appellant\\u2019s arguments (App. Br. 8-23) that 4 the Examiner failed to establish a prima facie showing that claims 4, 5, 7-13 5 and 35 are directed to non-statutory subject matter.  The Appellant asserts 6 that the claims involve observable and verifiable steps in a specific method 7 of playing card games which, when followed, weigh in favor of patent-8 eligibility (App. Br. 14-16).  We disagree.  Even if the claims are limited to a 9 particular card game, the claimed method still recites a series of mental steps 10 directed to a general concept of that particular card game which is abstract 11 and so sweeping as to cover both known and unknown uses of the concept 12 and be performed through any existing or future-devised machinery (Ans. 13 16).  See Interim Guidance for Determining Subject Matter Eligibility for 14 Process Claims in View of Bilski v. Kappos, 75 Fed. Reg. 43,922, 43,925 15 (Factor D(2)) (Jul. 27, 2010).  Such mental steps and general concepts are 16 not patentable subject matter.  In other words, the Appellant\\u2019s claims attempt 17 to patent and preempt an abstract idea of this particular card game in all 18 fields, and thus is ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 101.  See Bilski 19 v. Kappos, 130 S. Ct. 3218, 3231 (2010) (finding that claims that cover the 20 basic economic concept of hedging would preempt the use of the concept in 21 all fields). 22 Additionally, while not dispositive, the Appellant\\u2019s claim also fails to 23 meet the machine-or-transformation test, which is still an important clue in 24 determining patentable subject matter.  See Bilski v. Kappos, 130 S. Ct. at 25 3221.  For example, the Appellant\\u2019s claim contains no limitations as to the 26 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013258 Application 12/058,578  6  mechanism for playing the game, thus failing to meet the machine prong of 1 the machine-or-transformation test.  The Appellant also argues that 2 swapping results in a transformation to a new array of cards (App. Br. 13, 3 17).  We disagree.  The Appellant\\u2019s claims involve only a temporary change 4 in the position or location of the cards while playing the card game, which 5 does not transform any article into a different state or thing, thereby failing 6 to meet the transformation prong of the machine-or-transformation test.  See 7 In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 962 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (en banc). 8 Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 4, 5, 7-13 9 and 35 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 101 as directed to non-statutory subject matter. 10 The rejection of claims 4, 5, 7-14, 17-26 and 35 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103 11 (a) as being unpatentable over Pacey in view of Prerost.  12 Claims 4, 5, 7-14, and 17-26 13 The Appellant argues claims 4, 5, 7-14, and 17-26 as a group (App. Br. 14 38).  We select claim 8 as the representative claim for this group and the 15 remaining claims stand or fall with claim 8.  37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37 (c) (1) (vii) 16 (2011).    17 \\u201cSection 103 forbids issuance of a patent when \\u2018the differences between 18 the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the 19 subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention 20 was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject 21 matter pertains.\\u2019\\u201d  KSR Int\\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U. S. 398, 406 (2007).  22 It is well established that ordinary creativity is presumed on the part of one 23 of ordinary skill in the art.  Id. at 421, (\\u201c[a] person of ordinary skill is also a 24 person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton.\\u201d).   25 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013258 Application 12/058,578  7  We are not persuaded by the Appellant\\u2019s argument that the Examiner 1 failed to establish a prima facie showing of obviousness in rejecting claim 8 2 over the combination of Pacey and Prerost.  The Appellant contends that the 3 contents of the prior art documents must first be analyzed separately, to 4 determine whether in doing so a person skilled in the art would be motivated 5 to combine the prior art documents to obtain the claimed feature of \\u201csetting, 6 prior to swapping, a cost directly associated with the swapping to allow 7 wagering on the swapping,\\u201d as recited by independent claim 8 (App. Br. 36). 8 In alleging that the Examiner has not done so, the Appellant argues that 9 the Examiner has used \\u201cimpermissible hindsight\\u201d in combining Prerost with 10 Pacey because \\u201cPacey teaches a game that involves swapping of symbols 11 while Prerost teaches a card game (i.e., blackjack) that involves replacing of 12 cards and not swapping of cards,\\u201d and for that reason, Prerost does not 13 disclose the aforementioned step recited by claim 8 (App. Br. 37). 14 We disagree, as Pacey discloses a first embodiment (Figures 3-12) of a 15 multi-line video game, albeit with symbols rather than playing cards, where 16 after placing a wager as described at page 2, para. [0017), the player is \\u201cto 17 select pairs of vertically or horizontally adjacent symbols in the symbol 18 array 30 that, when swapped (exchanged), create a predefined, award-19 generating symbol combination\\u201d (page 2, para. [0018]). Thus, Pacey teaches 20 \\u201csetting, prior to swapping, a cost directly associated with the swapping to 21 allow wagering on the swapping,\\u201d as recited by claim 8.  We determine that 22 the purpose of the wager required by the first embodiment of Pacey is to 23 allow wagering on the swapping.  See FF1-2.  24 Furthermore, we are not persuaded that Prerost cannot properly be 25 combined with Pacey, because Prerost is only relied on for teaching that 26 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013258 Application 12/058,578  8  wagering after an initial wager in any game, whether a swapping card game 1 or replacing card game, was known in the art at the time of the invention.  2 Accordingly, Prevost suggests that wagers could have been placed in the 3 swapping game of Pacey at any point in time, so as to also meet \\u201csetting, 4 prior to swapping, a cost directly associated with the swapping to allow 5 wagering on the swapping,\\u201d as recited by claim 8 (Ans.27).   6 Thus, we do not agree that the Examiner\\u2019s rejection is an improper 7 hindsight reconstruction as it does not include knowledge gleaned only from 8 the Appellant\\u2019s disclosure, but rather takes into account the teachings of 9 Pacey and Prerost identified above; i.e., knowledge which was within the 10 level of ordinary skill at the time the claimed invention was made.  See In re 11 McLaughlin, 443 F.2d 1392, 1395 (CCPA 1971) (\\u201cAny judgment on 12 obviousness is in a sense necessarily a reconstruction based on hindsight 13 reasoning, but so long as it takes into account only knowledge which was 14 within the level of ordinary skill in the art at the time the claimed invention 15 was made and does not include knowledge gleaned only from applicant\\'s 16 disclosure, such a reconstruction is proper\\u201d).  See also Radix Corp. v. 17 Samuels, 13 USPQ2d 1689, 1693 (D.D.C. 1989) (\"[A]ny obviousness 18 inquiry necessarily involves some hindsight.\").   19 For the foregoing reasons, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 20 4, 5, 7-14, and 17-26 as being unpatentable over Pacey in view of Prerost. 21 Claim 35 22 While not separately argued by the Appellant, claim 35 is more limited 23 than claim 8 in further reciting \\u201cselecting, prior to playing, a cost associated 24 with the playing to allow playing the multiline card game\\u2026 setting, prior to 25 swapping, a cost associated with the swapping to allow wagering on the 26 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013258 Application 12/058,578  9  swapping, wherein the cost associated with the swapping is independent of 1 the cost associated with the playing.\\u201d   However, Pacey also discloses this 2 additional claim limitation.  3 In particular, Pacey discloses a second embodiment (Figures 13-20) that 4 teaches a video slot game where only instant winning combinations are 5 awarded.  See FF3.  With respect to the additional wagering step recited by 6 claim 35, Pacey discloses at para. [0035] that the swapping feature of the 7 first embodiment (Figures 3-12) can be combined with the second 8 embodiment (Figures 13-20).  See FF4. Thus, Pacey teaches that instant 9 winning combinations (if any) would first be identified, after which the 10 player would have the opportunity to extend the game by swapping.  In that 11 each of the first and second embodiments of Pacey requires a wager (as 12 disclosed at paras. [0004] and [0028]), Pacey teaches \\u201cselecting, prior to 13 playing, a cost associated with the playing to allow playing the multiline 14 card game\\u2026 setting, prior to swapping, a cost associated with the swapping 15 to allow wagering on the swapping, wherein the cost associated with the 16 swapping is independent of the cost associated with the playing,\\u201d as recited 17 by claim 35.   18 Additionally, our above analysis concerning the combination of Prerost 19 and Pacey as applied claim 8 is also applicable to the aforementioned feature 20 of claim 35. 21 For the foregoing reasons, we also sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of 22 claim 35 as being unpatentable over Pacey in view of Prerost. 23 DECISION 24 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013258 Application 12/058,578  10  The rejection of claims 4, 5, 7-13, and 35 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 101 as 1 directed to non-statutory subject matter is AFFIRMED. 2 The rejection of claims 4, 5, 7-14, 17-26, and 35 as being unpatentable 3 over Pacey in view of Prerost is AFFIRMED.  4 No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this 5 appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a).

We have jurisdiction under \\xa7\\xa7 134(b) and 306.  We affirm.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE Reexamination Proceedings  A request for ex parte reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737 (the \\u2019737 patent) was filed on July 1, 2009 and assigned Reexamination Control No. 90/009,636.  Requester did not seek reexamination of dependent claims 2-4 and they are therefore, not subject to reexamination.  (Req. 1; Ans. 2.) The \\u2019737 patent, entitled \\u201cProcess for Producing Thin-Film Transistor,\\u201d was issued on November 25, 1986, to Masafumi Shimbo, based on Application No. 06/743,092, filed June 10, 1985.  The \\u2019737 patent is now expired. The \\u2019737 patent is said to be assigned to LG Display Company, Ltd. (formerly, LG Philips LCD Company, Ltd.), said to be the assignee and real party in interest.  (Br. 2.)1   Appellant\\u2019s Invention  Appellant\\u2019s invention relates to a thin-film transistor that includes a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film, a low-resistivity                                            1 See also Assignment Abstract of Title, Reel 021147 Frame 0009 recorded June 19, 2008 and entered into the record of this proceeding as \\u201cTitle Report\\u201d on July 17, 2009. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  3 semiconductor film, and a conducting film that are successively deposited in lamination without exposure to an oxidizing atmosphere.  The source and drain electrodes are then selectively formed.  (Abstract; see also col. 1, ll. 6-7.)  Related Litigation Requester has informed us that the \\u2019737 patent has been the subject of at least the following litigation matters:  LG Philips LCD Co. v. NEC Corp., No. 99-cv-726 (D. Del. 1999), LG Philips LCD Co. v. Tatung Co. of America, No. 02-cv-6775 (C.D. Cal. 2002), LG Philips LCD Co. v. Jean Co., No. 03-cv-2866 (C.D. Cal. 2003), LG Philips LCD Co. v.

Appellant has also informed us that as of January 11, 2012, the filing date of the Appeal Brief in this reexamination proceeding, three of the above-entitled matters had been consolidated by the Delaware District Court:  Nos. 06-cv-726, 07-cv-357, and 08-cv-355.  (Br. 2.)  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  4 The Claim Independent claim 1 is exemplary and reproduced with minor formatting and disputed limitations in italics: 1. A process for producing a thin-film transistor comprising[:] a first step for forming a gate electrode on an insulating substrate, a second step for continuously depositing on said gate electrode and substrate a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film containing at least a low-resistivity semiconductor film without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere, a third step in which said high-resistivity semiconductor film and said conducting film are selectively etched so that they are partly left as an island region on said gate electrode, a fourth step for selectively forming a source electrode and a drain electrode both contacting a part of the surface of said island region and spaced apart from each other, a fifth step for selectively removing said conducting film exposed on said island region with said source and drain electrodes serving as at least a part of the mask, a sixth step for depositing a surface passivation film, and a seventh step for selectively removing said surface passivation film and exposing a part of each of said source electrode, drain electrode and gate electrode.  The Rejections Claim 1 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by Kawasaki (Japanese Patent Office Application No. S59-68975; April 19, 1984). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  5 Claim 1 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Kawasaki and Okubo (U.S. Patent No. 4,470,667; Sept. 11, 1984). Appellant relied upon the following2 in rebuttal to the Examiner\\u2019s rejection: Declaration under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.132 of Gary W. Rubloff, Ph.D., dated June 16, 2010 (\\u201cRubloff Declaration\\u201d).  ANALYSIS \\xa7 102 Rejection We are unpersuaded by Appellant\\u2019s arguments (Br. 10-13) that Kawasaki does not describe the limitation \\u201ca seventh step for selectively removing said surface passivation film and exposing a part of each of said source electrode, drain electrode and gate electrode,\\u201d as recited in independent claim 1. The Examiner found that the first metallic layer of Kawasaki corresponds to the limitation \\u201ca gate electrode.\\u201d  (Ans. 4, 7; Kawasaki, fig. 2a.)  The Examiner further found that forming opening areas in the passivation film of Kawasaki corresponds to the limitation \\u201ca seventh step for selectively removing said surface passivation film and exposing a part of each of said source electrode, drain electrode and gate electrode.\\u201d  (Ans. 5-6, Kawasaki, p. 6.)  In particular, the Examiner found that Kawasaki \\u201cdiscloses the step of forming an \\u2018insulating layer as a passivation film, . . . Thereafter                                            2  This opinion only addresses arguments made by Appellant.  Arguments not made are considered waived.  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii).  We have considered the declaration evidence to the extent raised by Appellant\\u2019s arguments.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  6 opening areas are formed on the insulating layer and the aforementioned wiring paths are exposed . . . and established as bonding pad areas\\u2019\\u201d and that \\u201c[t]he \\u2018aforementioned wiring paths\\u2019 as referred to would clearly include source, drain and gate wiring paths formed previously.\\u201d  (Ans. 7.)  We agree with the Examiner. Kawasaki3 relates to \\u201ca semiconductor device of non-single crystalline silicon\\u201d (p. 3, \\u201cIndustrial application field\\u201d), for example, a metal insulator semiconductor (MIS) transistor switching array forming an image display (p. 3, \\u201cConstitution of prior art and problems thereof,\\u201d para. 1).  Figures 2a-2d of Kawasaki illustrate a cross-section view of a process for manufacturing an amorphous silicon MIS-type transistor including forming a first metallic layer 2 (i.e., the claimed \\u201ca gate electrode\\u201d) on an insulative substrate 1.  (Id., para. 2.)  Kawasaki explains that the \\u201camorphous silicon layer 4\\u2019 without impurity was partially removed accompanying the selective removal of the amorphous silicon layer 5\\u2019 with impurity\\u201d (i.e., the claimed \\u201chigh-resistivity semiconductor film\\u201d and \\u201cconducting film,\\u201d respectively) and that \\u201can adequate passivation film must be formed, and the amorphous silicon layer 12 forming the channel must be protected from the external air.\\u201d  (Id., p. 4, para. 4.)  Kawasaki further explains that \\u201cthe insulating layer is formed as a passivation film or an interlayer insulating film\\u201d (i.e., the claimed \\u201csurface passivation film\\u201d) and that \\u201c[t]hereafter opening areas are formed on the insulating layer, and the aforementioned wiring paths are                                            3  Reference is made to the English-language translation supplied by the third-party requester, filed July 1, 2009 and cited by Appellant (see, e.g., Br. 11). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  7 exposed and established as bonding pad areas.\\u201d  (P. 6, \\u201cDescription of the preferred embodiments,\\u201d para. 4.)  Thus, because Kawasaki explains that opening areas are formed in the passivation film to expose wiring paths, Kawasaki teaches the limitation \\u201ca seventh step for selectively removing said surface passivation film and exposing a part of each of said source electrode, drain electrode and gate electrode.\\u201d Appellant argues that \\u201cthe gate wiring 9 [in] Kawasaki is formed after and on the gate insulating layer 3\\u201d and that \\u201cthe gate wiring 9 in Kawasaki[] cannot be the claimed \\u2018gate electrode\\u2019 because gate wiring 9 is formed after and on the gate insulating layer 3.\\u201d  (Br. 11.)  Contrary to Appellant\\u2019s arguments, the Examiner found that the first metallic layer 2 of Kawasaki, rather than the gate wiring 9 of Kawasaki, corresponds to the limitation \\u201ca gate electrode.\\u201d  (Ans. 4, 7.)  Accordingly, Appellant\\u2019s argument does not directly address the process step of Kawasaki (i.e., forming the first metallic layer 2) cited by the Examiner. Therefore, we agree with the Examiner that Kawasaki describes the limitation \\u201ca seventh step for selectively removing said surface passivation film and exposing a part of each of said source electrode, drain electrode and gate electrode.\\u201d We are further unpersuaded by Appellant\\u2019s arguments (Br. 13-17) that Kawasaki does not describe the limitation \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere,\\u201d as recited in independent claim 1. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  8 The Examiner found that the deposition method of Kawasaki for depositing the gate insulating layer, the amorphous silicon layer, and the amorphous silicon with impurities corresponds to the limitation \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere.\\u201d  (Ans. 4.)  In particular, the Examiner found that: [I]n Kawasaki [the] process of continuously depositing films by a single deposition step with gases switching from ammonia to without impurities to with impurities added into silane gas to form various layers of silicon nitride layer 3, high and low resistivity semiconductor layers 4, and 5 respectively in the same chamber and the result as noted above clearly demonstrate that the thin films are formed without exposing to oxidizing atmosphere. (Ans. 9; Kawasaki, p. 3.)  We agree with the Examiner. The Abstract of the \\u2019737 patent discloses that \\u201c[a] gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film, a low-resistivity semiconductor film and if necessary a conducting film are successively deposited in lamination without exposing them to any oxidizing atmosphere including atmospheric air.\\u201d  (Abstract (emphasis added).)  The \\u201cBackground of the Invention\\u201d section of the \\u2019737 patent, in reference to a conventional process in which an amorphous silicon film 4 is deposited, discloses that \\u201c[a]lthough such natural oxide can be removed by an aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF) or a similar substance, the possibility is still great that oxygen and its compounds as well as other impurities can collect on the laminate surface as it is exposed to the atmosphere.\\u201d  (Col. 1, ll. 35-40 (emphasis added).)  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  9 Furthermore, the \\u201cDetailed Description of Preferred Embodiments\\u201d section of the \\u2019737 patent describes that:  [S]uccessive deposition can be accomplished, for instance, by forming a silicon nitride (SiNx) film as gate insulating film 3 from a mixed gas of SiH4 and NH3, forming a high-resistivity a-Si:H film 4 by using SiH4 and forming a n+ a-Si:H film 20 from a mixed gas of PH3 and SiH4 in the same evacuated chamber in a plasma CVD [chemical vapor deposition] apparatus. (Col. 2, ll. 23-30.)  Therefore, reading the claim limitation \\u201cwithout exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere\\u201d in the context of the entire patent, we interpret this claim limitation as processing the thin-film transistor in a CVD (or similar) vacuum apparatus in the absence of an oxygen-containing gas, while avoiding exposure to atmospheric air.  In reference to manufacturing of the amorphous silicon MIS-type transistor, Kawasaki explains that: Next, the following are deposited on the entire surface: the gate insulating layer 3 composed of such material as silicon nitride, the amorphous silicon layer 4, and said amorphous silicon 5 with impurities. Layer 4, which serves as a donor or an acceptor, contains almost no impurity. The deposition method of these thin films is facilitated by plasma deposition using glow discharge of silane gas [SiH4]. If silicon nitride is desired in the gate insulating layer 3, then ammonia [NH3] should be added in the gas used for thin film fabrication. If amorphous silicon with impurities is desired, then diborane [B2H6] or phosphine [PH3] should be added.   (P. 3, \\u201cConstitution of prior art and problems thereof,\\u201d para. 2.)  Accordingly, because Kawasaki explains that the gate insulating layer 3, the amorphous silicon layer 4, and the amorphous silicon 5 are deposited in a glow discharge using silane, ammonia, and diborane or phosphine, we agree \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  10 with the Examiner that Kawasaki teaches the limitation \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere.\\u201d  Appellant argues that: The Declaration of Dr. Gary Rubloff . . . gives significant and extensive evidentiary support for the lack of inherency, based on standard mid-1980\\u2019s practices. . . . . Moreover, the glow discharge could be stopped, and the Examiner does not assert that it must be performed without stopping.  Therefore, the glow discharge process is not necessarily performed without stopping and, thus, not inherent. (Br. 16.)  However, as discussed previously, when claim 1 is construed in view of the \\u2019737 patent, we agree with the Examiner (Ans. 4, 9) that the claim limitation \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere\\u201d is broad enough to encompass manufacturing the amorphous silicon MIS-type transistor of Kawasaki, which includes depositing the gate insulating layer 3, the amorphous silicon layer 4, and the amorphous silicon 5 by glow discharge using silane, ammonia, and diborane or phosphine (i.e., in the absence of an oxygen-containing gas).  Appellant also argues that \\u201cit should be apparent to one skilled in the art that adhesions to the chamber walls in a vacuum environment become part of the internal \\u2018atmosphere\\u2019 during gassing processes,\\u201d with a citation to paragraph 18 of the Rubloff Declaration.  (Br. 16.)  Similarly, Appellant argues that \\u201c[s]imply stating that the process is under vacuum such as in a \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  11 glow discharge CVD process does not assure that the deposited material is not degraded by oxidation,\\u201d with a citation to paragraph 15 of the Rubloff Declaration.  (Br. 17.)  However, Appellant\\u2019s arguments are not commensurate in scope with claim 1 because the claim does not expressly recite the degree of chemical purity with respect to the oxygen content or degradation due to oxygen content.  Furthermore, the statements from paragraphs 15 and 18 of the Rubloff Declaration relied upon by Appellant lack persuasive factual support because such paragraphs do not cite to any persuasive corroborating documentation.  See In re Beattie, 974 F.2d 1309, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (\\u201c[D]eclarations themselves offer only opinion evidence which has little value without factual support.\\u201d).  Therefore, we agree with the Examiner that Kawasaki describes the limitation \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere.\\u201d  Accordingly, we sustain the rejection of independent claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b).    \\xa7 103 Rejection  We are unpersuaded by Appellant\\u2019s arguments (Br. 17-23) that the combination of Kawasaki and Okubo would not have rendered obvious independent claim 1, which includes the limitation \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere.\\u201d \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  12  In the alternative, the Examiner found that the manufacturing steps of Okubo, in which semiconductor layers (e.g. silicon nitride, amorphous silicon) are continuously formed in a vacuum vessel, correspond to the limitation \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere.\\u201d  (Ans. 6, 11-12; Okubo, col. 10, l. 66 to col. 11, l. 2.)  We agree with the Examiner.  Okubo relates to a thin film transistor array for a display apparatus, in particular, using amorphous silicon as a semiconductor.  (Col. 1, ll. 11-15.)  Figures 7A to 7H of Okubo illustrate the manufacturing process for forming a thin-film transistor in a vacuum vessel.  (Col. 10, ll. 61-65; see also col. 5, ll. 25-27.)  Okubo explains that \\u201c[w]hen an insulating layer is made of silicon nitride, semiconductor amorphous silicon, and an n+ layer amorphous silicon doped with phosphorus, arsenic, or the like, these materials can be continuously decomposed by glow discharged in one vacuum vessel.\\u201d  (Col. 10, l. 66 to col. 11, l. 2.)  Because Okubo explains that silicon nitride, amorphous silicon, and doped amorphous silicon are deposited by glow discharge in a vacuum vessel, Okubo teaches the limitation \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere.\\u201d  First, Appellant argues that \\u201cOkubo discloses that the steps in FIGs. 7B through 7D, or FIGs. 7B through 7E, can be conducted continuously and that a silicon nitride film, and an amorphous silicon film, and an n+ amorphous silicon film can be continuously decomposed in one vacuum \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  13 vessel\\u201d and that \\u201c[t]his in no way implies that exposure to an oxidizing atmosphere must be avoided,\\u201d with a citation to paragraph 21 of the Rubloff Declaration.  (Br. 18.)  However, as discussed previously, when claim 1 is construed in view of the \\u2019737 patent, the claim limitation \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere\\u201d is broad enough to encompass the exemplary manufacturing steps of Okubo for the a thin-film transistor in which a \\u201c[silicon nitride] insulating layer . . . , semiconductor amorphous silicon, and an n+ layer amorphous silicon . . . can be continuously decomposed by glow discharged in one vacuum vessel\\u201d (col. 10, l. 66 to col. 11, l. 2).  Furthermore, the statements from paragraph 21 of the Rubloff Declaration relied upon by Appellant lack persuasive factual support because this paragraph does not cite to any persuasive corroborating documentation.  See Beattie, 974 F.2d at 1313.  Second, Appellant also argues that \\u201cOkubo . . . teaches that \\u2018SiO2, Al2O3, and SiN3 may be preferably used as the material of the insulating layer 9\\u2019, and other metallic oxide, or fluoride may be used\\u2019\\u201d and that \\u201c[i]t should be clear that SiO2, Al2O3, and metallic oxides, by definition, contain oxygen, and are formed using an oxidizing atmosphere.\\u201d  (Br. 19.)  However, the Examiner cited the embodiment of Okubo, in which the insulating layer 9\\u2019 is formed of silicon nitride, rather than silicon dioxide or aluminum oxide, for teaching the limitation \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere.\\u201d  (Ans. 6, 11-\\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  14 12.)  Accordingly, Appellant\\u2019s argument does not directly address the embodiment of Okubo (i.e., a silicon nitride insulating layer) cited by the Examiner. Third, to rebut the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection, Appellant argues that \\u201cin October 1999, LPL [LG Philips LCD] filed suit against NEC for infringement of several patents including the \\u2019737 patent\\u201d and that \\u201c[i]n consideration for settling the pending infringement litigation brought by LPL, the two parties entered into a cross-licensing agreement in April 2001.\\u201d  (Br. 21.)  Similarly, Appellant argues that \\u201cin 2007, CPT [Chunghwa Picture Tubes] entered into a settlement release agreement with LPL after the adverse jury award involving the \\u2019737 patent.\\u201d  (Br. 22.)  However, this licensing activity may be due to factors unrelated to the unobviousness of the claims of the \\u2019737 patent such as the license being mutually beneficial or less expensive than defending infringement suits.  See EWP Corp. v. Reliance Universal, Inc., 755 F.2d 898, 907-08 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  Moreover, Appellant has not established a nexus between the success of such licensing activates and the claims of the \\u2019737 patent.   Last, to rebut the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection, Appellant argues that \\u201c[t]he process of the \\u2019737 patent is commercially successful\\u201d because \\u201cLG Display\\u2019s use of the asserted claims of the \\u2019737 patent enabled it to provide a higher quality, more valuable product\\u201d and \\u201c[b]y improving the electrical contact between the various layers of a TFT, the \\u2019737 patent improves the performance of the TFT and the operation of the LCD,\\u201d with a citation to paragraph 27 of the Rubloff Declaration.  (Br. 22.)  However, the statements in paragraph 27 of the Rubloff Declaration are conclusory \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-009636 Reexamination Control No. 90/009,508 U.S. Patent No. 4,624,737  15 statements that are based on insufficient evidence (e.g., a description of the product sold, including features of the invention as claimed, a description of the relevant market, and sales figures).  Additionally, Appellant has not established a nexus between the purported success of the LG TFT device and the claims of the \\u2019737 patent.  Thus, we agree with the Examiner that the combination of Kawasaki and Okubo would have rendered obvious independent claim 1, which includes the limitations \\u201ccontinuously depositing . . . a gate insulating film, a high-resistivity semiconductor film and a conducting film . . . without exposing them to an oxidizing atmosphere.\\u201d  Accordingly, we sustain the rejection of independent claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a).

Ans. 8.\\n\\nRejection [X\\u2014 Claims I 5, 3 7, 39-41, and 43-45\\n\\nThe Examiner \\ufb01nds that the photograph on page 72 of Alexander\\nshows the door of a refrigerator meeting the claim 37 limitation that \\u201cthe\\ndoor projects beyond a front edge of the furniture niche when the door is in\\nthe closed position and the refrigerating unit is installed in the furniture\\nniche.\\u201d Ans. 8, 15. Appellants argue that Alexander\\u2019s text and photos\\ndisclose the door \\ufb02ush with the front of the niche. Br. 13. In response, the\\nExaminer asserts that the handles constitute part of the refrigerator doors,\\nand that the handles clearly project forward of the front of the niche. Ans.\\n15. The Examiner further notes that Alexander even describes the handle\\nprojecting forward of the front of the niche. Id.\\n\\nThe Examiner has the more persuasive position. Appellants do not\\nprovide any counter to the Examiner\\u2019s reasonable position that the handles\\nconstitute part of the doors. Additionally, consistent with the Examiner\\u2019s\\nfinding, Alexander discloses that \\u201cthe handle will stick out\\u201d even when the\\n\\nrest of the door is \\ufb02ush with the cabinet. Alexander 73. Accordingly,\\n\\nAppellants do not apprise us of error in rejection IX with respect to claim 37.\\n\\nAppellants do not present separate arguments regarding claims 15, 39-41,\\nand 43-45. Accordingly, we sustain rejection IX with respect to claims 15,\\n\\n37, 39-41, and 43-45.\\n\\n10Appeal 2011-012236\\nApplication 10/584,163\\nRejection [X\\u2014 Claz\\'m I6\\n\\nAppellants argue that Alexander does not suggest positioning the front\\nedge of the body of the refrigerator \\ufb02ush with the front edge of the furniture\\nniche, as required by claim 16. Br. 14. Appellants also argue that\\nAlexander teaches away from the clai111ed invention because implementing\\nthe claimed relationship \\u201cwould prevent achieving a stated goal of\\nAlexander\\u201d that \\u201cwith % in. to l in. spacing around the unit, my cabinet can\\nbe \\ufb02ush with door.\\u201d Id. (citing Alexander 73). The Examiner responds that\\nthe choice between positioning the front face of the door \\ufb02ush with the front\\nof the niche or positioning the front of the refrigerator body \\ufb02ush with the\\nfront of the niche constitutes a matter of different aesthetic preferences for\\ndifferent people. Ans. 16.\\n\\nThe Examiner has the 111ore persuasive position. The Examiner\\u2019s\\nfinding that different people would have different preferences regarding\\nwhere to position a refrigerator for aesthetics is reasonable, and this \\ufb01nding\\nprovides rational underpinning for the determination of obviousness.\\nAppellants\\u2019 argument that Alexander does not expressly suggest the claimed\\npositional relationship does not undermine the Examiner\\u2019s determination of\\nobviousness because an obviousness analysis \\u201cneed not seek out precise\\nteachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim, for\\na court can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of\\nordinary skill in the art would employ.\\u201d KSR Int\\u2019! Co. v. T e/e\\ufb02ex, 1110., 550\\nU.S. 398, 417 (2007). Furthermore, we do not believe that Alexander\\nteaches away from the claimed invention by merely suggesting a preference\\nthat the door is \\ufb02ush with the front of the niche, as this disclosure does not\\n\\ncriticize, discredit, or otherwise discourage modifying the position of the\\n\\n11Appeal 2011-012236\\nApplication l0/584,163\\n\\nrefrigerator in a manner that would meet clai111 16. See In re 1\"u/Ion, 391\\nF.3d ll95, l20l (Fed. Cir. 2004).\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, Appellants do not apprise us of error in\\n\\nrejection IX with respect to claim 16.

The Examiner\\u2019s discussion of\\nrejection IX does not speci\\ufb01cally address the foregoing limitation of claim\\n21. See Ans. 7-8. l5-l 6.

The EXaminer\\u2019s\\ndiscussion of rejection IX does not speci\\ufb01cally address the foregoing\\nlimitation of claim 38. See Ans. 7-8, l5\\u2014l6. Accordingly, the Examiner\\ndoes not provide rational underpinning for a conclusion of obviousness of\\n\\nclaim 38.

The Examiner\\u2019s discussion of rejection IX\\ndoes not speci\\ufb01cally address the foregoing limitation of claim 42. See Ans.\\n7-8, 15-16. Accordingly, the Examiner does not provide rational\\nunderpinning for a determination of obviousness of claim 42. Consequently\\n\\nwe do not sustain rejection IX with respect to c1ai111 42.\\n\\nRejection X\\u2014 Claims 14, 23-25, 27, 28, 3], 32, 34-4], and 43-45.\\n\\nRegarding rejection X, Appellants \\ufb01rst challenge the Examiner\\u2019s\\ndetermination that it would have been obvious to modify King\\u2019s refrigerator\\nby adding Guertin\\u2019s decorative panel to the door. Br. 15-16; Ans. 8-9. In\\nsupport of this argument, Appellants note that King\\u2019s door \\u201cis rounded (at\\nleast) at the top and bottom (as shown in Fig. 1).\" Br. 15. Appellants argue\\nthat it would not have been obvious, and may not be possible, to add a\\ndecorative panel that slides over a door, as Guertin\\u2019s does, to a door like\\nKing\\u2019s that is not \\ufb02at. Id. at 15-16.\\n\\nIn response, the Examiner notes that the \\ufb01rst bend in Guertin\\u2019s\\nchannel, shown in the drawing in Figure 3, is the structure that holds the\\ndecorative panel on the door. Ans. 17. The Examiner further \\ufb01nds that\\nKing\\u2019s door would have structure similar to Guertin\\u2019s door where the \\ufb01rst\\nbend of the channel engages the door. Id. Accordingly, the Examiner\\ncontends, the rounded top and bottom of King would not affect installation\\n\\nof Guertin\\u2019s decorative panel. la\\u2019.\\n\\n13Appeal 2011-012236\\nApplication 10/584,163\\n\\nThe Examiner has the 111ore persuasive position. Appellants\\u2019\\narguments do not present any reason to doubt the Examiner\\u2019s reasonable\\n\\ufb01ndings that the portion of Guertin\\u2019s structure adjacent the first bend holds\\nthe decorative panel to the door. Nor do Appellants\\u2019 arguments present any\\nreason to doubt the EXan1iner\\u2019s \\ufb01nding that King\\u2019s door would have\\nstructure similar to Guertin\\u2019s door, i.e., a \\ufb02at inner edge, for engaging the\\nfirst bend of Guertin\\u2019s structure to hold the decorative panel on the door.\\nAccordingly, Appellants\\u2019 arguments regarding the curved top and bottom of\\nKing\\u2019s door do not apprise us of error in the Examiner\\u2019s determination that it\\nwould have been obvious to add Guertin\\u2019s decorative panel to Kings door.\\n\\nAppellants also argue that it would not have been obvious to modify\\nGuertin\\u2019s refrigerator to have King\\u2019s door con\\ufb01guration. Br. l6. This\\nargument does not apprise us of error in the rejection because the rejection\\ndoes not rest on a determination that it would have been obvious to modify\\nGuertin\\u2019s refrigerator to have King\\u2019s door con\\ufb01guration. Instead, the\\nrejection determines that it would have been obvious to substitute King\\u2019s\\nrefrigerator for Guertin\\u2019s in the furniture niche, and to add Guertin\\u2019s\\ndecorative panel to Kings refrigerator. Ans. 8-9.\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, Appellants\\u2019 arguments do not apprise us of\\nerror in rejection X witl1 respect to independent claims 14, 27, and 37.\\nAppellants do not present separate arguments with respect to claims 23-25,\\n28, 3 l, 32, 34-36, 38-41, and 43-45. Accordingly, we sustain rejection X\\nwith respect to claims 14, 23-25, 27, 28, 31, 32, 34-41, and 43-45.\\n\\n14Appeal 2011-012236\\nApplication 10/584,163\\nRejection X\\u2014 Claims 15, I6, 21, and 22\\n\\nIn support of rejection X, the Examiner \\ufb01nds that Guertin\\u2019s\\n\\u201crefrigerator body is behind the front edge of the niche . . . as seen in the left\\n\\ufb01gure on page 52.\\u201d Ans. 8. With respect to claims 15, 16, 21, and 22,\\nAppellants traverse rejection X by arguing that Guertin\\u2019s pictures do not\\nclearly show \\u201cexactly where the front edge of the body of the refrigerator is\\nlocated.\\u201d Br. 17.\\n\\nIn response, the Examiner maintains that certain speci\\ufb01c aspects of\\nthe left picture on page 52 of Guertin demonstrate that the body of the front\\nedge of the refrigerator must be behind the front edge of the furniture niche.\\nAns. 17. Apparently addressing claim 16, the Examiner adds that \\u201cnatural\\nmovements and adjustments of the refrigerator with the expansion and\\ncontraction of the house and the niche\\u201d would inherently cause the front of\\nthe body of the refrigerator to become flush with the front of the niche. Id.\\nat 17-18. Similarly, apparently addressing claim 21, the Examiner\\n\\u201cconsiders the same logic to apply to decorative end portions (black\\nchannels) would inherently be flush with the front of the furniture niche.\\u201d\\nId. at 18.\\n\\nAppellants have the more persuasive position. We agree with\\nAppellants that Guertin\\u2019s pictures do not show the refrigerator and the\\nfurniture niche clearly enough to establish that the relationship between the\\nfront edge of the refrigerator body and the front of the niche meets the\\nlimitation of claim 15. Additionally, we do not believe the Examiner\\u2019s\\nspeculative assertions regarding \\u201cnatural movements and adjustments of the\\nrefrigerator\\u201d provide a reasonable basis for finding that the relationship\\n\\nbetween the front edge of the ref\\ufb01gerator and the niche would necessarily\\n\\n15Appeal 2011-012236\\nApplication 10/584,163\\n\\nchange to meet the li111itations of claims 16 and 21. Accordingly, we do not\\nsustain rejection X with respect to claim 15. 16, and 21, or with respect to\\n\\nclai111 22, whicl1 depends fro111 claim 21.\\n\\nRejection X \\u2014 Claim 26\\n\\nAppellants argue that King and Guertin fail to teach or suggest the\\nclaim 26 limitation that the refrigerating unit comprises \\u201ca plurality of doors\\nof different depth which can be mounted on the body.\" Br. 18. The\\nExaminer counters that Guertin discloses a plurality of doors of different\\ndepths that can be mounted to the refrigerator body, speci\\ufb01cally one door\\nwithout a decorative panel and another door with a decorative panel. Ans.\\n18. This reasoning provides a sound basis for the \\ufb01nding that Guertin\\ndiscloses the limitations of claim 26, and Appellants\\u2019 do not respond with\\nany challenge to this reasoning. Accordingly, Appellants do not apprise us\\nof error in rejection X with respect to claim 26. Consequently, we sustain\\n\\nthe rejection.\\n\\nRejection X \\u2014 Claims 33 and 42\\n\\nAppellants argue that King and Guertin fail to teach or suggest the\\nli111itations of claims 33 and 42 related to the claimed axis. Br. 18. The\\nExaminer responds by first referring to the Examiner\\u2019s above-discussed\\ncontention that King inherently meets the claim 33 limitation regarding the\\npivot axis. Ans. 18. For the reasons discussed above in connection with\\nrejection VIII and claim 33, we do not believe the Examiner has provided a\\nreasonable basis for finding that King necessarily meets the claim li111itations\\n\\nregarding the pivot axis.\\n\\n16Appeal 2011-012236\\nApplication 10/584,163\\n\\nThe Examiner further contends that Guertin\\u2019s refrigerator inherently\\nmeets the limitations of claims 33 and 42 regarding the pivot axis.

The limitations in question include the clai111 14 li111itation that \\u201cthe\\ndoor projecting beyond a front edge of the furniture niche when the\\nrefrigerating unit is installed in the furniture niche,\" the claim 27 limitation\\nthat \\u201cthe door is adapted for projecting beyond a front edge of the furniture\\nniche when the door is in the closed position and the refrigerating unit is\\ninstalled in the furniture niche,\" and the claim 37 limitation that \\u201cthe door\\nprojects beyond a front edge of the furniture niche when the door is in the\\nclosed position and the refrigerating unit is installed in the furniture niche.\\u201d\\nId. Appellants argue that \\u201cthe relationship between the door and the front\\nedge of the furniture niche is a positively claimed feature and is not merely\\n[an] intended use.\\u201d Id.\\n\\nIn response, the Examiner notes that each of the foregoing claim\\nlimitations has been treated as having patentable weight. Ans. 9. Regarding\\nclaims 14 and 27, the Examiner contends the limitations in question require\\nthe claimed refrigerator to be capable ofuse in a 111anner that meets the\\nrecited relationship between the door and the niche. Id. The Examiner treats\\nclaims 14 and 27 in this 111anner because the Examiner does not believe that\\nclaims 14 and 27 include the niche as part of the claimed combination.\\n\\nWe agree with the Examiner\\u2019s assessment of the patentable weight of\\nthe limitations of claims 14 and 27. Because each of claims 14 and 27\\n\\nrecites \\u201c[a] refrigerating unit /br installing in furniture niche\\u201d (emphasisAppeal 2011-012236\\n\\nApplication 10/584,163\\n\\nadded\\u2019), and because the body of each of clai111s l4 and 27 does not recite the\\nniche as an element. we agree with the Examiner that claims l4 and 27 do\\nnot include the niche as part of tl1e claimed co111bination. Given this, we\\nbelieve that the claim 14 and 27 li111itations in question recite an intended\\nuse and/ or functional limitations, such that a refrigerator capable of being\\nused in the recited manner meets the claim limitations. See In re Schrez\\'ber,\\n128 F.3d 1473, 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (ifprior art device is capable of\\nmeeting intended use or function recited in a claim, the prior art structure\\nmeets the claim language).\\n\\nRegarding claim 37, the Examiner states that the rejections of this\\nclaim treat the claim as requiring the niche as part of tlie claimed\\ncombination. Ans. 9. Appellants do not point to any reason to doubt this\\nstatement. Accordingly, any concerns Appellants may have about the\\nExaminer giving patentable weight to the limitations of claim 37 appear\\n\\nunfounded.\\n\\nRejection I\\n\\nThe Examiner \\ufb01nds that claim 24 does not comply with the written\\ndescription requirement because the Speci\\ufb01cation does not mention making\\na decorative panel removable or disclose or show any structure that would\\nallow removing a decorative panel. Ans. 4. In response. Appellants argue\\nonly that \\u201cone skilled in the art of refrigerators would have known from the\\ntotality of the disclosure that the decorative panel can be removable from the\\ndoor.\\u201d Br. 7. Without pointing to a single speci\\ufb01c portion of their\\ndisclosure that provides written description for claim 24, Appellants do not\\n\\napprise us of error in the rejection. Accordingly, we sustain rejection 1.Appeal 2011-012236\\nApplication 10/584,163\\n\\nRejections II- VI\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 traversal of each of rejections ll\\u2014Vl rests entirely on an\\nargument that paragraph [007] of the Speci\\ufb01cation de\\ufb01nes the language\\n\\u201cprojecting beyond a front edge of the furniture niche\\u201d to mean that \\u201cin the\\nclosed position the door projects far enough that the decorative panel\\ncovering the door projects further than the doors of cupboard elements\\nadjacent to the furniture niche of the refrigerating unit.\" Br. 7-10. The\\nExaminer responds that the Speci\\ufb01cation provides no de\\ufb01nition of the\\nlanguage \\u201cprojecting beyond a front edge of the furniture niche.\\u201d Ans. 10-\\n13.\\n\\nWe agree with the Examiner. Paragraph [007] of the Speci\\ufb01cation\\ndiscusses how a re\\ufb01igerating unit can be installed with the decorative panel\\nprojecting further than adjacent cupboard doors. While this provides an\\nexample of how Appellants\\u2019 disclosed system may be implemented, it does\\nnot provide a de\\ufb01nition of any language. Furthermore, even if it did provide\\na de\\ufb01nition, paragraph [007] would not support Appellants\\u2019 proposed\\nde\\ufb01nition because, unlike Appellants\\u2019 proposed de\\ufb01nition, paragraph [007]\\nsays nothing about \\u201cthe closed position\\u201d of the refrigerating unit\\u2019s door.\\nAccordingly, Appellants\\u2019 arguments do not apprise us of error in rejections\\n\\nll-VT. Consequently, we sustain rejections ll-VI.\\n\\nRejection V11\\nRegarding rejection Vll, Appellants \\ufb01rst reassert their argument that\\nparagraph [007] of the Speci\\ufb01cation provides a special de\\ufb01nition of the\\n\\nlanguage \\u201cprojecting beyond a front edge of the furniture niche.\\u201d Br. 10.Appeal 2011-012236\\n\\nApplication 10/584,163\\n\\nFor the reasons discussed above in connection with rejections ll\\u2014Vl, this\\nargument does not apprise us of error in rejection Vll.\\n\\nAppellants also argue that Cherry does not disclose a furniture niche.\\nEven if accurate, this assertion does not apprise us of error because, as\\ndiscussed above, we do not believe claim 14 requires the niche as part of tl1e\\nclai111ed co111bination.\\n\\nAppellants also argue that Cherry does not disclose a door projecting\\nbeyond a front edge of the furniture niche. Br. 10. In support of this\\nargument, Appellants note that Cherry discloses its invention meets a need\\nto allow the front of a refrigerator to sit essentially even witl1 the front of\\nadjacent cabinets. Id. In response, the Examiner notes that claim 14 does\\nnot require the door to be in a closed position when it projects forward of the\\nfront edge of the furniture niche. Ans. 13. The Examiner then asserts that\\nthe open position of Cher1y\\u2019s door would meet the claim l4 limitation. Id.\\nThese assertions support the anticipation \\ufb01nding with sound reasoning, and\\nAppellants\\u2019 arguments do not provide a convincing counter to this\\n\\nreasoning. Accordingly, we sustain rejection Vll.\\n\\nRejection V[II- Claims /4, 23, 26, 27, 3], 32, and 34-36\\n\\nRegarding clai111 l4, Appellants repeat the argument discussed above\\nthat paragraph [007] de\\ufb01nes the language \\u201cprojecting beyond a front edge of\\nthe furniture niche.\\u201d Br. 1 1. For the reasons discussed in connection with\\nrejections H-VI, this argument does not apprise us of error.\\n\\nRegarding claims 14 and 27, Appellants further argue that King does\\nnot disclose a furniture niche, does not disclose a door in the positional\\n\\nrelationship recited in claims 14 and 27, and does not \\u201csuggest[] that theAppeal 2011-012236\\nApplication 10/584,163\\n\\nrefrigerator . . . is for installing in a furniture niche or any positional\\nrelationship between the door and a furniture niche.\\u201d Id. The Examiner\\nresponds that the claims do not require a furniture niche, they only require a\\nrefrigerator capable of installation in a furniture niche. Ans. 14. As\\ndiscussed above, we agree with this assessment of tl1e li111itations of claims\\n14 and 27. Accordingly, Appellants\\u2019 arguments that King does not disclose\\nan intention to install or actual installation of the refrigerator in a furniture\\nniche in a manner meeting the positional relationships recited in claims 14\\nand 27 does not apprise us of error in the rejection. Appellants do not\\npresent separate arguments for clai111s 23, 26, 31, 32, and 34-36.\\nAccordingly, we sustain rejection VIII with respect to claims 14, 23, 26, 27,\\n31, 32, and 34-36.\\n\\nRejection V[II\\u2014 Claim 28\\n\\nThe Examiner \\ufb01nds that the door of King\\u2019s refrigerator would project\\nbeyond a front edge of a furniture niche when the door is open. Ans. 7.\\nAppellants note that claim 28 refers to the closed position of the door. Br.\\n12. Speci\\ufb01cally, claim 28 recites that the \\u201cdoor is adapted for projecting\\nbeyond a front face of a cabinet door adjacent to the refrigerating unit in the\\nfurniture niche when the door is in the closed position.\\u201d Br. 22, Claims\\nAppendix. The Examiner does not \\ufb01nd that King\\u2019s door is capable of\\nmeeting the positional relationship recited in claim 28 when in the closed\\nposition. Appellants\\u2019 argument apprises us of error in rejection VIII with\\n\\nrespect to claim 28, and we do not sustain this rejection.Appeal 2011-012236\\nApplication 10/584,163\\nRejection V[II\\u2014 Claim 33\\n\\nAppellants argue that King does not suggest the claim 33 limitation\\nthat \\u201cthe protruding edge of tl1e door being in between the axis and the front\\nedge of the body.\" Br. 12. Appellants note that King does not show a pivot\\naxis of its door, n1ucl1 less suggest any particular location of a pivot axis. 1a\\u2019.\\nThe Examiner responds that King 111ust inherently have the pivot axis\\nbeyond the protruding edge of the door in order to allow opening of the\\ndoor. Ans. 14. The Examiner expounds that \\u201c[a]ny other position would\\nforce a tail end of the door to contact the body of the refrigerator and prevent\\nthe door from opening.\\u201d Id.\\n\\nWe do not believe the Examiner has established a prinzafacie case\\nthat King inherently meets the limitation of claim  Without further\\nevidence or explanation, we do not believe the Examiner has provided a\\nreasonable basis for \\ufb01nding that any pivot axis position other than the\\nclaimed one would prevent the door from opening. The Examiner asserts\\nthat the prior art contains numerous examples of doors with their pivot axes\\nlocated in the claimed location, but the Examiner does not identify where the\\nprior art shows these numerous examples. Ans. 14. We do not sustain\\n\\nrejection Vlll with respect to claim \\n\\nRejection IX\\n\\nAppellants first traverse rejection 1X generally by arguing that there\\nwould have been no motivation to add a different door to Alexander\\u2019s\\nrefrigerator to meet the limitations of the claims.

See App. Br. 14-15. According to Appellants,\\nclaim 1 recites providing step-by-step audible instructions and waiting for\\naudible input from the user between steps. See App. Br. 15. \\u201cThat is, the\\nRC [rolling code] and/or FC [fixed code] programming instructions are a\\npart of an actual programming process and take place during the\\nprogramming process.\\u201d 1d,; accord Reply Br. 4. Appellants argue that\\nproviding audible instructions during the programming process is bene\\ufb01cial\\nin that it assists the user in performing what would otherwise be a dif\\ufb01cult\\ntask. See App. Br. 16.\\n\\nAs to paragraph 0080 ofC11uey \\u2019602, Appellants admit that \\u201cChuey\\ndescribes that a remote control (eg, speaker 480) can audibly communicate\\nto a user feedback during the programming mode and that the remote control\\ncan audibly communicate to the user programming instructions.\\u201d Reply\\nBr. 3.

As to paragraph 0080\\u2019s description of using the speaker to\\nprovide programming instructions, Appellants argue that \\u201cChuey does not\\nindicate that this is nothing more than the remote control audibly\\ncommunicating the programming instructions being simply read out aloud\\nfor a user to hear in the manner like an audio book,\\u201d as distinguished from\\nproviding instructions in a step\\u2014by\\u2014step fashion. Reply Br. 3.\\nWe are not persuaded of Examiner error. Chuey \\u2019602, at paragraph\\n\\n0078, explains that a remote control can provide \\u201cinstructions for\\nprogramming and using programmable control 30\\u201d as well as \\u201cstatus and\\ncontrol feedback to the user in training [programming]\\u201d the programmable\\ncontrol using a graphical display. Cl1uey \\u2019602 also teaches that\\nprogramming the control is a step-by-step process that \\u201crequires interaction\\nwith the user,\\u201d for example, pausing while waiting for input from the user.\\nChuey \\u2019602 W 0069, 0073; Figs. 14-15. Thus, Chuey at least suggests\\nproviding programming instructions on a step-by-step basis, as part of the\\nprogramming process. while that process is taking place. Chuey \\u2019602 further\\nexplains that \\u201cmicrophone 482 and speaker 480 may be used to provide\\nprogramming instructions, interactive help, and the like.\\u201d Cl1uey \\u2019602\\n\\n11 0080. Thus, the step-by-step instructions can be provided in audible form.\\n\\nMoreover. even if Chuey \\u2019602\\u2019s teaching is limited to simply reading\\n\\ninstructions out loud. \\u201cin the manner like an audio book\\u201d (Reply Br. 3),\\nmodifying Chuey \\u2019602\\u2019s system to provide voice instructions on a step-by-\\n\\nstep basis would 11aVe been a logical extension and would have required noAppeal 201 l-005380\\n\\nApplication 11/652,984\\n\\nmore than ordinary skill.

The Appellants further contend that Luburic is not reasonably pertinent\\nto the particular problem with which the applicant was concerned because it is\\n\\u201ctrying to provide a liquid\\u2014tight seal between a lid and its associated container\\u201d\\nrather than \\u201cprotecting from environmental effects \\ufb01ber optic terminals secured or\\nmounted to a wall or other vertical surface.\\u201d App. Br. 8.\\n\\nAppellants also argue that the combination of Luburic with Napiorkowski\\nfails to disclose or suggest an \\u201cinner lip\\u201d and an \\u201couter lip\\u201d as claimed in claim 1\\nbecause Luburic discloses a skirt or \\ufb02ange instead of a lip. Appellants argue that\\nsuch a skirt or \\ufb02ange would be in contact with liquid inside the container of\\nLuburic and therefore not a reasonable modi\\ufb01cation of Luburic. Id. at. 9. In\\naddition, Appellants argue that the combination does not teach or suggest \\u201ca point\\nof contact between the tongue and the inner lip is at least twice a distance from the\\nsurface as a point of contact between the tongue and the outer lip\\u201d for the reason\\nthat Luburic does not disclose an \\u201cinner lip\\u201d and an \\u201couter lip\\u201d (id. at l0) and\\nbecause the point of contact is the same between the upper edge 12 and botl1 of the\\ninner leg 42 and the outer leg 44 of Luburic (id. at l0-l l).\\n\\nAppellants further contend that the combination of Luburic with\\nNapiorkowski does not teach or suggest \\u201cwherein the inner lip . . . extends from\\nthe surface a distance sufficient to enable the inner lip to deform when the tongue\\nis selectively sealingly engaged with at least the inner lip\\u201d as recited in claim 7. 1a\\u2019.\\n\\nat l l.

Did the Appellants show reversible error in the Examiner\\u2019s combination\\nof N apiorkowski with Luburic?\\n\\n2. Did the Appellants show reversible error in the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion\\nthat a person of ordinary skill in the art would have found it obvious to\\nform an inner lip and an outer lip such that \\u201cthe inner lip extends fro111\\nthe surface at least twice a distance as the inner lip extends from the\\nsurface\\u201d as recited in claim 1, in View of the applied prior art?\\n\\n3. Did the Appellants show reversible error in the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion\\nthat a person of ordinary skill in the art would have found it obvious to\\nform an inner lip such that it \\u201cextends from the surface a distance\\nsufficient to enable the inner lip to deform when the tongue i_s selectively\\nsealingly engaged with at least the inner lip of the groove\\u201d as recited in\\nclaim 7, in view of the applied prior art?\\n\\nIssue 1\\nAppellants\\u2019 arguments that Luburic (1) is non-analogous art because it is\\n\\ndirected to a container/lid combination (App. Br. 7) and (2) is not reasonably\\npertinent to the particular problem with which the applicant was concerned because\\nLuburic \\u201cis concerned with keeping liquids sealed within a container\\u201d (id. at 8) are\\nnot persuasive. We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s \\ufb01nding that N apiorkowski \\u201cis\\nclearly concerned with protecting the components within the terminal from\\nenvironmental effects, since the terminal is provided with a removable cover and is\\nfor use within the field, such as connected to a drop cable.\\u201d Ans. 7; Napiorkowki 1]\\n\\n$1 [0005], [0029], (\\u201cprotective outer cover\\u201d). Moreover, Napiorkowski teaches anAppeal 2011-005890\\n\\nApplication ll/975,440\\n\\nembodiment where the protective cover includes a lip around the periphery that\\nincludes a channel and a second sidewall that \\u201cserves as a barrier to the ingress of\\nliquid, sucl1 as water, into [the] NlD\\u201d and forms \\u201ca mechanical seal\\u201d.\\nNapiorkowski 11 [0054]. Napiorkowski further teaches that \\u201c[t]he channel may\\noptionally include an elastic sealing material, such as a rubber gasket, for\\nimproving the seal between cover 214 and base 202.\\u201d Id. Therefore, one of\\nordinary skill in the art of \\ufb01ber optic terminals would have reasonably turned to the\\nart of seals between cover and base to protect optic cables in an NID including\\nwater-tight seals. See Ans. 7 (\\u201cLuburic also provides the additional advantage of\\nproviding a liquid\\u2014tight seal without the use of a gasket member. These teachings\\nof Luburic are therefore applicable to the cover/base mating arrangement of the\\nterminal taught by Napiorkowski et al.\\u201d); (,7/I Reply Br. 4. Thus, the Exa1niner\\u2019s\\ncombination of Napiorkowski and Luburic is proper.\\n\\nIssue 2\\nAppellants\\u2019 contention that the combination of the liquid seal-tight mating\\n\\narrangement of Luburic with Napiorkowski does not teach or suggest the features\\nof claim l hinges on whether the relationship of the inner and outer legs of Luburic\\nteach or suggest a seal having an inner lip that \\u201cextends from the surface at least\\ntwice a distance as the outer lip extends form the surface\\u201d and whether the\\nrelationship ofboth legs to a tongue is sucl1 that \\u201cthe inner lip is at least twice a\\ndistance from the surface as a point of contact between the tongue and the outer\\nlip\\u201d as recited in claim 1. The preponderance of the evidence favors the\\nExaminer\\u2019s conclusion of obviousness of claim 1. We adopt the Examiner\\u2019s\\nanalysis with respect to claim 1 on pages 4-6 and 9-15 of the Answer as our own.\\n\\nWe add the following discussion primarily for e111pl1asis.Appeal 2011-005890\\nApplication ll/975,440\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 argument that the lower portion 46 of Luburic cannot be\\nconsidered part of the lip because it would not be reasonable to have such a\\n\\u201c\\ufb02ange\\u201d inside the container of Luburic (App. Br. 9-10; Reply Br. 5-6) is merely\\nattorney argument and cannot take the place of objective evidence. See, e. g., In re\\nHuang, 100 F.3d 135, 139-40 (Fed. Cir. 1996); In re De Blauwe, 736 F.2d 699,\\n705 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The argument also fails to consider the teaching of the\\nreference as a whole, which is a sealing arrangement between two lips divided by a\\ngroove that engages a tongue. See In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir.\\n1992) (obviousness is determined on the basis of the evidence as a whole). We are\\nnot persuaded by Appellants (Reply Br. 6) that reversing the outer leg and the inner\\nleg orientation in the seal of Luburic would change the function of the liquid-tight\\nseal mating arrangement. Therefore the Examiner\\u2019s description of the seal taught\\nby Luburic as being the mirror image of that of claim 1 is reasonable.\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 argument that the point of contact the between the upper edge of\\nthe container and the inner leg in Luburic is the same or less distance from the\\nsurface as the point of contact between the upper edge and the outer leg (App. Br.\\nl0-l l) appears to read into claim 1 the requirement that the first point of contact\\nbetween the one lip relative to the other. We decline Appellants\\u2019 invitation to read\\ninto claim 1 an embodiment from the Speci\\ufb01cation. See SuperGuz\\'de Corp. V.\\nDir\\'ecTV1;\\'nterprz\\'ses, 1170., 358 F .3d 870, 875 (Fed.

FREDMAN, and ERICA A. FRANKLIN, Administrative Patent Judges.  FREDMAN, Administrative Patent Judge.  DECISION ON APPEAL This is an appeal1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 involving claims to a communications device.  The Examiner rejected the claims as obvious.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We reverse.                                               1 Appellant identifies the Real Party in Interest as Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (see App. Br. 3). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011159  Application 11/278,582   2  Statement of the Case  Background The Specification teaches that a \\u201ccommunication device may generate and maintain a log of the phone numbers identifying the communication devices with which the communication device communicates\\u201d (Spec 1 \\xb6 0002).  According to the Specification, \\u201crecency is not necessarily the best single predictor of the particular phone number that an individual is most likely to call at any given time from the communication device\\u201d (Spec. 1 \\xb6 0004).  The Claims Claims 1-22 are on appeal.  Claims 1 and 19 are representative and read as follows (emphasis added):     1.  A communication device comprising: a memory to store a first call log including a plurality of communication identifiers corresponding to a plurality of party identifiers related to call activity of the communication device, wherein at least two of the plurality of communication identifiers correspond to a single party identifier of the plurality of party identifiers; logic configured to generate, based on the first call log, a first call list including a first set of party identifiers, of the plurality of party identifiers, arranged in an order based on call frequency information respectively associated with the first set of party identifiers, wherein the first set of party identifiers includes the single party identifier, and the call frequency information for the single party identifier includes the call activity related to each of the at least two of the plurality of communication identifiers; and a display to display at least a portion of the first call list.  19. A computer readable medium that stores instructions executable by a processing device operating in a \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011159  Application 11/278,582   3  communication terminal, the computer readable medium comprising; instructions to determine a probability that a particular party identifier corresponding to at least two communication identifiers, of a plurality of communication identifiers stored in a memory of the communication terminal, will be selected for communication, by a user of the communication terminal, from a plurality of party identifiers corresponding to the stored communication identifiers, wherein the probability is based on past communications initiated to each of the at least two of the stored communication identifiers; and instructions to order at least two party identifiers, of the plurality of party identifiers, based on the probabilities determined for the at least two party identifiers, wherein the at least two party identifiers include the particular party identifier.  The issues  A. The Examiner rejected claims 19-22 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Harless2 and Levy3 (Ans. 4-6).  B. The Examiner rejected claims 1-7 and 10-18 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Kreitzer4 and Levy (Ans. 6-11).  C. The Examiner rejected claim 8 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Kreitzer, Levy, and Borngr\\xe4ber5 (Ans. 11-12).  D. The Examiner rejected claim 9 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Kreitzer, Levy, and Bocking6 (Ans. 12-13).                                              2 Harless et al., US 6,084,954, issued Jul. 4, 2000. 3 Levy et al., US 2007/0064908 A1, published Mar. 22, 2007. 4 Kreitzer, S., US 2004/0192270 A1, published Sept. 30, 2004. 5 Borngr\\xe4ber et al., US 7,215,881 B2, issued May 8, 2007. 6 Bocking et al., US 7,280,652 B2, issued Oct. 9, 2007. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011159  Application 11/278,582   4  Since the same issue is dispositive for each of these rejections, we will consider them together. The Examiner finds that Harless teaches the elements of claims 1 and 19, except that Harless does not teach \\u201ca particular party identifier corresponding to at least two communication identifiers\\u201d (Ans. 4).  Similarly, the Examiner finds that Kreitzer teaches the elements of claims 1 and 19, but finds that Kreitzer \\u201cdoes not disclose the method, wherein at least two of the plurality of communication identifiers correspond to a single party identifier of the plurality of party identifiers\\u201d (id. at 7). For each of the rejections, the Examiner relies upon Levy to teach \\u201ca particular party identifier corresponding to at least two communication identifiers\\u201d (id. at 4). The Examiner finds it obvious to \\u201cto make or receive a call from the plurality of communication identifiers correspond to a single party as taught by Levy in Harless, in order to manage the plurality of communication identifiers correspond to a single party identifier\\u201d (id. at 5; cf. Ans. 7). The issue with respect to each of the rejections is: Does the evidence of record support the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that Harless or Kreitzer, in view of Levy, render obvious a call list \\u201carranged in an order based on call frequency information respectively associated with the first set of party identifiers, wherein the . . . call frequency information for the single party identifier includes the call activity related to each of the at least two of the plurality of communication identifiers\\u201d as required by claim 1?   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011159  Application 11/278,582   5  Findings of Fact 1. The Specification teaches that the  Communication identifier field 320 may include information that identifies a communication device associated with a destination or a source of a call respectively placed or received by communication device 100.  For, example, identifier field 320 may include information, such as a phone number, an e-mail address, etc., that uniquely identifies a communication device.  (Spec. 10 \\xb6 0054.) 2. The Specification teaches that \\u201cthe most frequently called communication identifier may be listed as first in the call list even when calls to any number of other communication identifiers have been made since the last call to the most frequently called communication identifier.\\u201d (Spec. 13 \\xb6 0061.) 3. The Specification teaches that \\u201ctwo or more of the multiple communication identifiers associated with \\u2018JULIE\\u2019 (i.e., 555-555-1234, 555-555-8901, 555-555-9012, etc.) may be considered as a single communication identifier for purposes of ordering the entries\\u201d (Spec. 16 \\xb6 0071). 4. Harless teaches that a \\u201csystem 240 for predicting a future communication event pertaining to the PDA 110 is embodied in the data processing and storage circuitry 115\\u201d (Harless, col. 4, ll. 54-56). 5. Harless teaches that the \\u201cpredicting logic 260 examines a current communication event and predicts the future communication event based on both the current communication event and the correlation\\u201d (Harless, col. 5, ll. 2-4). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011159  Application 11/278,582   6  6. Harless teaches that \\u201c[p]ast communication event information, for instance, incoming numbers and outgoing numbers, are stored in the database 220\\u201d (Harless, col. 5, ll. 15-17). 7. Harless teaches that \\u201cthe correlating logic 250 relates a plurality of earlier communication events to a plurality of later communication events. The correlating logic 250 may thus more accurately determine the user\\u2019s communication pattern\\u201d (Harless, col. 5, ll. 46-50). 8. Harless teaches that: The predicting logic 260 then takes a current communication event, the incoming number, and predicts a future communication event, the outgoing number. The predicting logic 260 makes this prediction based on the incoming number and the associated correlation in the probability matrix 255.   The predicting logic 260 then sends, in this embodiment, an ordered list of outgoing numbers to the retrieval circuitry 270, which then displays the outgoing numbers on the display of the communication station 100.  (Harless, col. 5, ll. 55-64.) 9. Harless teaches that by \\u201cpredicting the future communication event, the present invention allows the communication station 100 to provide its user with greater convenience and ease of use and, also, reduces the cost of the device\\u201d (Harless, col. 6, ll. 2-6). 10. Kreitzer teaches a method \\u201cof forming a hotlist in a portable communication device comprises the steps of tracking calls made from the portable communication device, maintaining a recent call list, and reordering the recent call list using entries stored in association with other programs \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011159  Application 11/278,582   7  within the portable communication device to provide the hotlist\\u201d (Kreitzer 1 \\xb6 0007). 11. Kreitzer teaches that the \\u201cmethod can further include the steps of tracking frequent calls and promoting the frequent calls in the hotlist based on at least one among the frequency of the frequent calls\\u201d (Kreitzer 1 \\xb6 0007). 12. Kreitzer teaches that the \\u201cprocessor can be further programmed to track frequent calls and promote the frequent calls in the hotlist based on at least one among a frequency of the frequent calls, a timeframe of the frequent calls\\u201d (Kreitzer 1 \\xb6 0008). 13. Kreitzer teaches that the \\u201cprocessor 12 and/or prediction engine 26 can be programmed to track frequent calls and promote the frequent calls in the hotlist based on at least one among the frequency of the frequent calls (see \\u2018Overall Counter\\u2019 column)\\u201d  (Kreitzer 2 \\xb6 0019). 14. Kreitzer teaches that the \\u201cthe phone can keep a scratchpad memory to track numbers called most often between 5-6 PM or between any given time period . . . and these frequently called numbers can be incrementally promoted to the top of the hotlist as the 5 o\\u2019clock hour approaches or any given incremental hour approaches\\u201d (Kreitzer 2 \\xb6 0023). 15. Levy teaches a \\u201ctelecommunications device includes a telephony controller; a contacts controller, said contacts controller configured to maintain a plurality of contact telephone numbers for individual contacts\\u201d (Levy, abstract).   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011159  Application 11/278,582   8  Principles of Law  \\u201c\\u2018[R]ejections on obviousness grounds cannot be sustained by mere conclusory statements; instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness.\\u201d\\u2019  KSR Int\\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007) citing In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Analysis Harless or Kreitzer reasonably teaches a communications device which creates a call list arranged in order of call frequency based on communication identifiers, as Kreitzer teaches that a \\u201cmethod can further include the steps of tracking frequent calls and promoting the frequent calls in the hotlist based on at least one among the frequency of the frequent calls\\u201d (Kreitzer 1 \\xb6 0007; FF 11; cf. Harless, FF 8).  The issue is whether Levy\\u2019s teaching of a \\u201ccontacts controller configured to maintain a plurality of contact telephone numbers for individual contacts\\u201d (Levy, abstract; FF 15) provides a reason to modify either Harless or Kreitzer so that the \\u201ccall frequency information for the single party identifier includes the call activity related to each of the at least two of the plurality of communication identifiers\\u201d as required by claims 1 and 19. Appellant contends that \\u201cthe Examiner has not explained how KREITZER\\u2019s hotlist, based on call frequency, would take into account multiple contact telephone numbers associated with an individual contact\\u201d (App. Br. 42-43).  Appellant \\u201csubmits that the Examiner\\u2019s allegation that KREITZER\\u2019s hotlist would necessarily be based on past communications initiated to each of the multiple contact telephone numbers-as opposed to \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011159  Application 11/278,582   9  considering them individually-is based on impermissible hindsight, using Appellant\\u2019s disclosure\\u201d (App. Br. 43). The Examiner finds that \\u201cit would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to incorporate the teaching of LEVY into [the] teaching of KREITZER for the purpose of managing a plurality of communication identifiers [that] correspond to a single party identifier by storing these data in the communication terminal\\u201d (Ans. 22; Also see Ans. 16-17 for Harless and Levy motivation statement). We find that Appellant has the better position.  The Examiner provides the conclusory result, that the combinations of either Kreitzer or Harless with Levy would have been obvious, but provides no specific reason why the ordinary artisan would have had any incentive or rationale to incorporate multiple different numbers associated with a single individual as taught by Levy (FF 15) into the hotlist of Kreitzer (FF 10-14) or the predicting logic of Harless (FF 4-9).  It is not sufficient to demonstrate that each of the components is known.  See KSR, 550 U.S. at 418 (\\u201ca patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was, independently, known in the prior art\\u201d).  Without a reason, incentive, rationale or other basis for combining the disclosures, we are constrained to agree with Appellant that the combination \\u201cis based on impermissible hindsight\\u201d (App. Br. 43). Conclusion of Law The evidence of record does not support the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that Harless or Kreitzer, in view of Levy, render obvious a call list \\u201carranged in an order based on call frequency information respectively associated with \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011159  Application 11/278,582   10  the first set of party identifiers, wherein the . . . call frequency information for the single party identifier includes the call activity related to each of the at least two of the plurality of communication identifiers\\u201d as required by claim 1, or the corresponding limitation of claim 19. SUMMARY  In summary, we reverse the rejection of claims 19-22 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Harless and Levy.  We reverse the rejection of claims 1-7 and 10-18 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Kreitzer and Levy.  We reverse the rejection of claim 8 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Kreitzer, Levy, and Borngr\\xe4ber.  We reverse the rejection of claim 9 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious over Kreitzer, Levy, and Bocking.  REVERSED   cdc \\x0c'},\n",

A method for selecting one or more transmit\\nantennas from which to transmit control channel\\ninformation to one or more receivers, said method\\ncomprising the steps of:\\n\\nreceiving channel quality infonnation\\nmeasurements from the one or more receivers, wherein\\nsaid channel quality infon11ation measurements are a\\nfunction of the channel quality of downlink data\\nchannels; and\\n\\nanalyzing the received channel quality information\\nmeasurements to select which transmit antenna(s) to use\\nfor transmitting the control channel information to the\\none or 111ore receivers.\\n\\nTHE REJECTIONS\\n\\nClaims 1-16 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable\\nover Grant (US 2005/0250544 Al; published Nov. 10, 2005) and Kim\\n(US 2005/0220000 A1; published Oct. 6, 2005).

See Ans. 4. However, the Examiner \\ufb01nds\\nthat Grant does not teach that the information to be transmitted is control\\nchannel information. See id. Rather, the Examiner finds that the\\ninformation being transmitted is downlink data channel information. See\\nAns. 12. To bridge this gap, the Examiner finds that Kim, in a similar \\ufb01eld\\nof endeavor, teaches sending control channel information on the same\\nantenna(s) as the downlink data channel information. See Ans. 5.\\nCombining Grant and Kim, the Examiner concludes that it would have been\\nobvious to transmit Grant\\u2019s control channel data using the same selected\\nantenna(s\\u201c) as used for transmitting the downlink data. See id.\\n\\nAppellants admit that Grant and Kim together teach \\u201cthe use of\\ndownlink data channel quality measurements for selecting antennas to\\ntransmit 1 control and data channel information.\\u201d Reply Br. 2.\\nAccording to Appellants, however, claim l requires z\\'mz\\u2019ependenlly selecting\\nwl1icl1 transmit antenna(s) to use for transmitting control channel\\ninformation. Reply Br. 2-3. Appellants argue:\\n\\nThe novel functionality of [Appellants\\u2019] invention allows for\\nthe selection of antennas for the transmission of control channel\\ninformation, as a function of the channel quality of downlink\\ndata channels, independently from the selection of antennas for\\nthe transmission of such downlink data channels - which is not\\ndisclosed by Grant.Appeal 2011-005254\\n\\nApplication ll/859,148\\n\\nApp. Br. 5; accord fa\\u2019. at 7 (\\u201c[Appellants\\u2019] clai111ed invention is directed to\\nsituations in which antennas for control channel transmission can be\\nindependently selected as a function of downlink data channel quality, which\\nis not taught by either Grant or Ki1n.\"\\u201c).\\n\\nThe Examiner responds that claim 1 is not limited to selecting\\nantennas for the transmission of only control channel information. Ans. 12.\\nWe agree. In the Examiner\\u2019s combination, because downlink data channel\\nquality measurements are analyzed to select which transmit antenna(s) to use\\nfor transmitting both data channel and control channel information, such\\nquality measurements are necessarily analyzed to select wl1icl1 transmit\\nantenna(s) to use for transmitting control channel information. The plain\\nlanguage of claim 1 encompasses selecting transmit antenna(s) to use for\\ntransmitting control channel information alone or for transmitting both data\\nchannel and control channel information.\\n\\n\\u201cDuring examination, claims are to be given their broadest reasonable\\ninterpretation consistent with the specification, and claim language should\\nbe read in light of the speci\\ufb01cation as it would be interpreted by one of\\nordinary skill in the art.\" In re Am. Acad. 0fSci. Tech. Ctr, 367 F.3d 1359,\\nl364 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Appellants have\\nnot shown that claim 1 should be construed more narrowly. In particular,\\nclaim l does not recite selecting antennas for transmitting only control\\nchannel infonnation, or selecting antenna(s) for transmitting control channel\\ninformation independently of selecting antenna(s) for transmitting downlink\\ndata. Appellants contend that in all of the Speci\\ufb01cation\\u2019s examples,\\n\\n\\u201cantennas for control channel transmission can be independently selected as\\n\\na function of downlink data channel quality . . . .\" App. Br. 7.

Rather, it recites analyzing the received channel quality\\ninformation measurements to select which antennas to use. Although\\nchannel quality information measurements are recited to be a function of\\nchannel quality, clai111 1 does not recite any criteria to evaluate when\\nanalyzing channel quality information measurements. The Examiner \\ufb01nds\\nthat Grant\\u2019s \\u201cChannel Quality Indicator\" feedback signal is a channel quality\\ninformation measurement that is a function of the channel quality of a\\ndownlink data channel. See Ans. 4. The Examiner also \\ufb01nds that this\\nfeedback signal is analyzed in selecting a transmit antenna. See id. We see\\nno error in those \\ufb01ndings, or in the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion (Ans. 4-5) that\\nKim\\u2019s teachings would have suggested analyzing the feedback signal to\\nselect an antenna for both downlink and control channel information.\\n\\nAppellants further argue that \\u2018\\u2018[t]he Examiner\\u2019s analysis is based on\\n\\nthe faulty assumption that the claimed invention always results in the same\\n\\nantennas being selected for the transmission of control information as are\\nutilized for the transmission of data.\\u201d App. Br. 6. This is not what the\\n\\nExaminer \\ufb01nds. Rather, the Examiner \\ufb01nds that invention of claim lAppeal 2011-005254\\n\\nApplication ll/859,148\\n\\nencompasses (but is not li111ited to) selecting the same antennas for the\\ntransmission of both control channel data and downlink data. See Ans. 12.\\nThus, Appellants\\u2019 argument is unpersuasive.\\n\\nAppellants also contend that the same antennas could be selected for\\ntransmission of botl1 downlink information and control channel information\\nwithout the need to analyze channel quality in making the selection. See\\nApp. Br. 6-7; Reply Br. 2-3. While it may be possible to do so, this\\nargument fails to consider the combined teachings of Grant and Kim, in\\nwhich channel quality measurements are analyzed in making the selection.\\nThus, this argument is also unpersuasive.\\n\\nAccordingly, we sustain the rejection of (1) independent claim 1; (2)\\nindependent claim 1 l, which Appellants argue is patentable for analogous\\nreasons (App. Br. 7); (3) claims 2-10, which depend on claim 1 and are not\\nargued separately with particularity; and (4) claims 12-16, which depend on\\n\\nclaim 11 and are not argued separately with particularity.\\n\\nREJECTION OF CLAIM l7 UNDER 35 USC. \\xa7 lO3(a)\\nClaim 17 depends on claim 1 1.

ADAMS, ERIC GRIMES, and JEFFREY N. FREDMAN, Administrative Patent Judges.  GRIMES, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 involving claims to a system and method for automated completion of a medical imaging study, which have been rejected for obviousness.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We reverse.                                             1 Appellants identify the Real Party in Interest as Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc. (Appeal Br. 2). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-010353  Application 11/764,425   2  STATEMENT OF THE CASE An imaging study of a patient may include multiple image examination reports, and \\u201cdetermination of conditions upon which an imaging study is deemed completed may depend on the status of more than one of these reports\\u201d (Spec. 1:14-21).  \\u201cIn known systems an imaging study typically needs to be manually signed and indicated as being complete,\\u201d which \\u201cconsumes substantial healthcare worker time and lacks reliability\\u201d (id. at 1:22-27). Claims 1-17 are on appeal.  Claim 1 is illustrative and reads as follows (emphasis added): 1. An automated system for managing completion of a medical imaging study having one or more different reports associated with one or more different personnel, comprising: at least one processing device executing stored machine readable instructions and including, a user interface providing a plurality of display images; a configuration processor for enabling a user, using a display image, to assign a predetermined completion status to a plurality of different reports requiring completion by a corresponding plurality of different personnel for designation of an associated imaging study as complete, said predetermined completion status being used to indicate individual reports of said plurality of different reports are complete as required for said associated imaging study to be designated complete, said imaging study being produced during a patient imaging examination; a monitoring processor for automatically monitoring stored indicators indicating current status of said plurality of different reports requiring completion for designation of said associated imaging study as complete; and a decision processor for, in response to said monitoring of said stored indicators, automatically determining whether a current status of a report matches a corresponding predetermined completion status of a report for individual reports associated with said imaging study and in response to \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-010353  Application 11/764,425   3  a match for said individual reports, automatically changing status of said imaging study by designating said imaging study is complete and signed.  Similar to claim 1, the other independent claims on appeal (claims 8 and 16) require \\u201can imaging study produced during a patient imaging examination and comprising a plurality of different reports requiring completion by a corresponding plurality of different personnel for designation of an associated imaging study as complete\\u201d (Appeal Br. 22, 24 (Claims Appendix)). The claims stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as follows:   \\u2022  Claims 1, 6-8, 10, 11, 13, and 16 based on Menschik,2 Reiner,3 and Hahn4 (Answer 4); \\u2022  Claims 2, 9, and 17 based on Menschik, Reiner, and Hahn (Answer 12); \\u2022  Claims 2, 9, and 17 based on Menschik, Reiner, Hahn, and Lyshkow5 (Answer 13); and \\u2022  Claims 3-5, 12, 14, and 15 based on Menschik (Answer 15). I. The Examiner has rejected claims 1, 6-8, 10, 11, 13, and 16 as obvious based on Menschik, Reiner, and Hahn (Answer 4).  The Examiner separately rejected claims 2, 9, and 17 based on the same references (Answer 12).  Since claims 2, 9, and 17 depend from claims 1, 8, and 16,                                            2 Menschik et al., US 2004/0034550 A1, Feb. 19, 2004. 3 Reiner, US 7,607,079 B2, Oct. 20, 2009. 4 Hahn et al., US 2006/021317, Sept. 21, 2006. 5 Lyshkow, US 2009/0132281 A1, May 21, 2009. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-010353  Application 11/764,425   4  respectively, we will address the rejection of claims 2, 9, and 17 along with the rejection of the claims from which they depend. The Examiner finds that Menschik discloses a system meeting most of the limitations of claim 1 but differing in that, among other things, \\u201cMenschik does not specifically disclose[ ] the claimed aspect of a plurality of different reports requiring completion by a corresponding plurality of different personnel for designation of an associated imaging study as complete\\u201d (Answer 8).  The Examiner finds that Reiner discloses this limitation because it describes a system in which a technologist and a radiologist make annotations on \\u201ckey images\\u201d during a review of medical images, after which \\u201cthe radiologist may then sign the annotated image by electronically placing his/her initials . . . on the image\\u201d (id.)  The Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious \\u201cto add this feature [to] Menschik because this would allow [a] radiologist and technologist to comment on medical images\\u201d (id.). Appellants argue that Reiner does not disclose the limitation of \\u201cassign[ing] a predetermined completion status to a plurality of different reports requiring completion by a corresponding plurality of different personnel for designation of an associated imaging study as complete\\u201d (Appeal Br. 9).  Appellants argue that \\u201c[a]nnotations are merely comments NOT a completion status\\u201d (id.) and that \\u201cReiner teaches different personnel add annotations to the same image,\\u201d whereas the claims require \\u201cdifferent personnel [to] complete their own respective individual corresponding report\\u201d (id.). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-010353  Application 11/764,425   5  We agree with Appellants that the Examiner has not shown that Reiner discloses a processor for assigning a completion status to \\u201ca plurality of different reports requiring completion by a corresponding plurality of different personnel,\\u201d as required by the claims.  Reiner discloses \\u201ca multi-input reporting and editing tool, which performs as a dynamic instrument to allow multiple users\\u2019 input into creating a single electronic, comprehensive report\\u201d (Reiner, col. 3, ll. 43-46, emphasis added). In an exemplary embodiment, Reiner describes the use of its tool in radiology (id. at col. 3, ll. 56-57).  Reiner states that a technologist performs an imaging study on a patient and saves the image data (id. at col. 8, ll. 56-59).  \\u201cThe completed imaging data set will be analyzed by the technologist, and \\u2018key images\\u2019 identified for annotation.  In one embodiment, the technologist will insert the annotations using gesture-based reporting [GBR].\\u201d  (Id. at col. 9, ll. 5-8.) \\u201c[T]he radiologist would review the images with the annotations made by the technologist . . . [and] make his/her own GBR annotations on \\u2018key images\\u2019 in his/her review process\\u201d (id. at col. 9, ll. 45-49).  \\u201cAfter completion of image review, interpretation, and diagnosis, the radiologist may then sign the annotated image by electronically placing his/her initials . . . on the image\\u201d (id. at col. 10, ll. 27-30).   Thus, Reiner\\u2019s product and method provide \\u201ca single electronic, comprehensive report\\u201d (id. at col. 3, ll. 43-46) that includes input from multiple users.  Although application of Reiner\\u2019s method to radiology can include annotations of multiple images (\\u201ckey images\\u201d) by multiple users, it does not require completion of a plurality of different reports by a plurality \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-010353  Application 11/764,425   6  of different users, as required by claim 1.  Rather, when the appropriate input has been obtained from the desired personnel, the radiologist initials the \\u2013 single \\u2013 report to indicate that it is complete (id. at col. 10, ll. 27-30).   We therefore agree with Appellants that Reiner\\u2019s description of a method allowing annotation of a single imaging study by different people does not meet the limitation of claim 1 requiring a \\u201cprocessor for enabling a user . . . to assign a predetermined completion status to a plurality of different reports requiring completion by a corresponding plurality of different personnel.\\u201d  Independent claims 8 and 16 require a processor (claim 8) or a step (claim 16) corresponding to the relevant limitation of claim 1.  Therefore, we reverse the rejection of claims 1, 2, 6-11, 13, 16, and 17 as obvious based on Menschik, Reiner, and Hahn. II. The Examiner has also rejected claims 2, 9, and 17 as obvious based on Menschik, Reiner, Hahn, and Lyshkow.  The Examiner, however, relies on Lyshkow only for disclosure of the added limitation of the dependent claims (Answer 14).  The Examiner does not point to any disclosure in Lyshkow that would teach or suggest the limitation, discussed above, that is missing from Reiner.  We therefore reverse the rejection of claims 2, 9, and 17 as obvious based on Menschik, Reiner, Hahn, and Lyshkow for the reason discussed above with respect to claims 1, 8, and 16. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-010353  Application 11/764,425   7  III. The Examiner has rejected claims 3-5, 12, 14, and 15 as obvious based on Menschik (Answer 15).  Claims 3-5 depend on claim 1; claims 12, 14, and 15 depend on claim 8.   The Examiner has acknowledged, however, that \\u201cMenschik does not specifically disclose[ ] the claimed aspect of a plurality of different reports requiring completion by a corresponding plurality of different personnel for designation of an associated imaging study as complete\\u201d (Answer 8).  This limitation is required by both claim 1 and claim 8, and therefore also by claims 3-5, 12, 14, and 15.  See 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112, fourth paragraph (\\u201cA claim in dependent form shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations of the claim to which it refers.\\u201d). The Examiner\\u2019s statement of the rejection of claims 3-5, 12, 14, and 15 provides no reasoning to show that Menschik teaches or suggests the limitation that the Examiner has acknowledged not to be disclosed by Menschik.  The Examiner therefore has not provided a prima facie case that Menschik would have made obvious a method or system meeting all of the limitations of claims 3-5, 12, 14, and 15, including the limitations that are included as a result of these claims\\u2019 dependency from claim 1 or claim 8.

RUGGIERO, JOHNNY A. KUMAR,  and MICHAEL J. STRAUSS, Administrative Patent Judges.  KUMAR, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004462 Application 11/422,657   2STATEMENT OF THE CASE  Appellant appeals under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from the Final Rejection of claims 1-34.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).    We affirm.  Rather than reiterate the arguments of Appellant and the Examiner, we refer to the Appeal Brief (\\u201cApp. Br.\\u201d) filed August 4, 2010, the Answer (\\u201cAns.\\u201d) mailed October 13, 2010, and Reply Brief (\\u201cReply Br.\\u201d) filed November 22, 2010, for the respective details.  We have considered in this decision only those arguments Appellant actually raised in the Briefs.  Any other arguments which Appellant could have made but chose not to make in the Brief are deemed to be waived.  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii).  Appellants\\u2019 Invention Appellant\\u2019s invention involves a handheld communication device that detects a first network at a first location, and establishes a communication link with the detected first network.  See Fig. 5.  The handheld communication device utilizes the first network in exchange for allowing the first network to send messages associated with the location of the first network to the handheld communication device.  The first network may be located in a store in a mall or a department in a store.  The messages sent to the first handheld communication device may be advertisements or coupons associated with the location where the first network may be present.  When the handheld communication device is moved from one location to another, the handheld communication device detects a second network at the other location, and establishes a connection with the second network in exchange \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004462 Application 11/422,657   3for allowing messages associated with the location of the second network, which may be another store in the mall or another department within the store.  See generally Spec. \\xb6\\xb6 [0015], [0030].   Claim 1 is illustrative of the invention and reads as follows: 1. A method for communicating information in a communication system, the method comprising: detecting by a first wireless handheld communication device (WHCD), a first wireless network at a first location comprising a first wireless access device; establishing by said first WHCD, a communication link with the first wireless network via the first wireless access device; and receiving by said first WHCD, when the first WHCD is within operating range of the first wireless network at the first location, wirelessly targeted services offered by the first wireless network at the first location, in exchange for the first WHCD being granted free access rights to utilize the first network to access another network communicatively coupled to the first wireless network at the first location.  The Examiner\\u2019s Rejections The Examiner rejected claims 1-8 and 13-20 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as being anticipated by Stewart (US 2006/0183467 A1, Aug. 17, 2006).  Ans. 4. The Examiner rejected claims 9, 10, 21, and 22 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Stewart in view of Crolley (US 2006/0242010 A1, Oct. 26, 2006).  Ans. 6. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004462 Application 11/422,657   4The Examiner rejected claims 11, 12, 23, and 24 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Stewart in view of Barnes (US 2003/0220835 A1, Nov. 27, 2003).  Ans. 7. The Examiner rejected claims 27, 31, 33, and 34 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Stewart in view of Rissanen (US 7,308,254 B1, Dec. 11, 2007).  Ans. 8. The Examiner rejected claims 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, and 32 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Stewart in view of Rissanen, and further in view of Ma (US 2007/0249286 A1, Oct. 25, 2007).  Ans. 10.  ANALYSIS We adopt as our own the findings and reasons set forth in the Examiner\\u2019s Answer (see Ans. 4-18).  We highlight and address specific findings and arguments for emphasis as follows. Appellant first contends that the Examiner erred in rejecting independent claims 1 and 13 because Stewart does not disclose that \\u201cthe first WHCD alone, is the device which carries out the \\u2018detecting\\u2019 operation,\\u201d or that \\u201conly the first WHCD carries out the detection operation in the first wireless network.\\u201d  App. Br. 11-12 (emphasis in original omitted, emphasis ours).  Appellant also contends that the Examiner erred in rejecting claims 1 and 13 because Stewart does not disclose \\u201cAppellant\\u2019s invention that the WHCD 502 is the only one device which first \\u2018detects\\u2019 the presence of the interenet/WLAN 504, then \\u2018establishes\\u2019 a communication link with the internet/WLAN 504.\\u201d  App. Br. 16 (emphasis in original omitted, emphasis ours).  Appellant\\u2019s arguments are not commensurate with the scope of the \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004462 Application 11/422,657   5claims.  Neither of claims 1 or 13 recites \\u201calone,\\u201d \\u201conly,\\u201d \\u201cfirst detects,\\u201d or \\u201cthen establishes.\\u201d Regarding dependent claim 7, Appellant contends that \\u201cStewart simply does not disclose or suggest storing the MU ID at that instant in order to grant the alleged \\u2018access rights\\u2019.\\u201d  App. Br. 18 (emphasis ours).  Appellant\\u2019s arguments are not commensurate with the scope of the claim.  Claim 7 does not recite \\u201cat that instant.\\u201d Regarding remaining dependent claims, while Appellant raised additional arguments for patentability of the cited dependent claims (App. Br. 19-28), we find that the Examiner has rebutted in the Answer each and every one of those arguments supported by sufficient evidence.  Ans. 14-17.  As to Appellant\\u2019s contentions that the references are not combinable, we find that the Examiner\\u2019s suggestion for the proposed modification in the prior art suffices as an articulated reason with some rational underpinning to establish the prima facie case of obviousness.  Ans. 7-11.  Therefore, we adopt the Examiner\\u2019s findings and underlying reasoning, which are incorporated herein by reference. Consequently, we find no error in the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of the claims.  CONCLUSION  The Examiner did not err in rejecting claims 1-8 and 13-20 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as being anticipated by Stewart. The Examiner did not err in rejecting claims 9, 10, 21, and 22 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Stewart in view of Crolley. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004462 Application 11/422,657   6The Examiner did not err in rejecting claims 11, 12, 23, and 24 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Stewart in view of Barnes. The Examiner did not err in rejecting claims 27, 31, 33, and 34 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Stewart in view of Rissanen. The Examiner did not err in rejecting claims 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, and 32 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Stewart in view of Rissanen, and further in view of Ma.  DECISION  We affirm the Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting claims 1-34.

See Ans. 4-5 (citing Chen. 1111 [0001]. [0022]). 17-18 (citing\\nChen, 1 [0021]). The Examiner relies on Lee to teach receiving and\\nacknowledgement of the broadcast message (Chen\\u2019s \\u201cgeneral page,\\u201d Lee\\u2019s\\n\\u201cdummy page\\u201d) with location information that includes sector information.\\nSee Ans. 5-6 (citing Lee, 1111 [0009], [0012], [0020], [0032l), 17-18 (citing\\nLee, 11 [0010]). The Examiner relies on Crockett to teach that it is known to\\nuse common channels (i.e., the recited \\u201csignaling channel\\u201d) for group call\\ninitiation messages. See Ans. 6-7 (citing Crockett, 1111 [0034], [0039]; Fig.\\n1), 19-20 (citing Crockett, 1111[0034], [0039], [0194]; Fig. 1).\\n\\nAppellants contend as follows:\\n\\nThere is no reason to combine the teachings of Lee with\\nthe teachings of Chen absent knowledge of the present\\ndisclosure, i.e., impermissible hindsight. Chen conducts\\ngeneral paging only when an IP [(lntemet Protocol)] datagram\\nis marked for SDB [(Sl1ort Data Burst)] delivery. Lee on the\\nother hand performs \\u201cdummy paging,\\u201d which is not general\\npaging as in Chen, whenever the mobile device is in an idle\\nstate for a predetermined time. lt matters not that Lee may\\nprovide sector information in response to the \\u201cdummy paging\\u201d\\nas a person of ordinary skill in the art would have no reason to\\nconsider the disclosure of Lee since there is no reason to go to\\nLee for any teachings in order to modify Chen.\\n\\nBr. 13. We are not persuaded of error.Appeal 201 l-003466\\nApplication 11/156,178\\nLee teaches:\\n\\nThe fact that the location information includes . . . the sector\\nnumber . . . forms the foundation for allowing to \\ufb01nd out a\\nlocation of a mobile station 110 as the unit of a repeater R.\\nThat is to say, a location Qfcz mobile station 1 10 can be more\\nprecixelyfound out than in the PLMN [(Public Land Mobile\\nNetwork)] wl1ic11 tracks the location as the unit of a base\\nstation.\\n\\nLee, 11 [0032] (emphases added).\\n\\nThe Examiner relies on Lee for teaching that location information\\nreturned bene\\ufb01cially includes sector information, which allows a more\\nprecise direction of messages to the target MS. See Ans. 8, 18 (citing Lee,\\n1111 [0009]-[OO10]). We \\ufb01nd that one of ordinary skill in the art would l1ave\\nunderstood and been motivated by the advantages of more precise direction\\nof messages, as taught by Lee, regardless of the type of broadcast message\\n(Chen\\u2019s general page or Lee\\u2019s dummy page) used to gather the location\\ninformation or the circumstances (Cl1en\\u2019s lP datagram marked for SDB\\ndelivery or Lee\\u2019s mobile device in an idle state for a predetermined time)\\nunder which it is gathered.

DECISION ON APPEAL \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007341 Application 12/380,154  2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE Appellants seek our review under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 of the Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting claims 1-14, which are all of the pending claims.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  Appellants\\u2019 representative presented oral argument on October 22, 2013. We AFFIRM. THE INVENTION Appellants\\u2019 invention relates to vacuum seals that include an O-ring received in a groove.  Spec., paras. [0009], [0010].  Claims 1 and 9 are the independent claims on appeal.  Claim 1 reproduced below, is illustrative of the claimed subject matter. 1. An improved vacuum seal comprising: an O-ring having a circular cross-section with a diameter D; a first mating part having a first sealing surface with a groove formed therein configured to receive the O-ring, wherein said groove has a radially outer side wall, a radially inner side wall and a bottom wall that extends between said outer and inner side walls with said bottom wall being disposed parallel to said first sealing surface, a groove mouth having a width W in the first sealing surface between said outer and inner side walls; and a second mating part having a second sealing surface, wherein said second sealing surface mates with said first sealing surface; wherein said groove has a modified dovetail shape with at least one side wall having a compound slope formed with a first portion forming an angle of less than 90 degrees with \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007341 Application 12/380,154  3 respect to the bottom wall, said first portion connected to said bottom wall to form a junction therebetween, and a second portion between said first portion and said first sealing surface, said second portion extending substantially perpendicular to said first sealing surface wherein the cross-sectional area of the O-ring is greater than the cross-sectional area of said groove. REFERENCES The Examiner relies upon the following prior art references: Bryant Bertrem Hosokawa  US 3,575,431 US 3,910,555 US 7,311,311 B2 Apr. 20, 1971 Oct. 7, 1975 Dec. 25, 2007 The Examiner also relies upon Appellants\\u2019 Admitted Prior Art (\\u201cAAPA\\u201d).  See Ans. 3 (citing Spec., paras. [0002]-[0007], figs. 2, 3). REJECTIONS The following rejections are before us on appeal: I. Claims 1-6 and 8-12 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over AAPA, Bryant, and Bertrem.  Ans. 3. II. Claims 7, 13, and 14 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over AAPA, Bryant, Bertrem, and Hosokawa.  Ans. 4. ANALYSIS Rejection I The Examiner finds that AAPA discloses a single or double dovetail-shaped groove for receiving an O-ring in which one or both sidewalls form an angle of less than 90 degrees with respect to the bottom wall but does not disclose a sidewall having the claimed compound slope.  Ans. 3; see Spec., \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007341 Application 12/380,154  4 figs 2, 3.  The Examiner finds that Bryant discloses a groove for holding an O-ring that has at least one sidewall comprising a portion forming an angle of less than 90 degrees with respect to the bottom wall and a portion extending substantially perpendicular to a sealing surface, and concludes it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the shape of the sidewalls of the AAPA groove by providing compound sidewalls as taught by Bryant.  Id. at 3-4.  Next, the Examiner finds that Bertrem discloses a dovetail-shaped groove for holding an O-ring that has a cross-sectional area that is greater than the cross-sectional area of the groove and concludes it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the combination of AAPA and Bryant to use an O-ring having a greater cross-sectional area as taught by Bertrem so that the O-ring will remain securely seated during use.  Id. at 4. Appellants argue that the proposed modification is improper because it \\u201cwould change the principle of operation of the prior art invention being modified.\\u201d  App. Br. 5 (emphasis added).  Specifically, Appellants assert that the entire thrust of Bryant \\u201cis to provide a groove configured to receive an o-ring or sealing member so as to provide for the desired deflection of deformation of the o-ring\\u201d (id.), and \\u201cone can see that it would change the operation of Bryant to combine it with Bertrem\\u201d (id. at 6).  Appellants similarly argue that the proposed modification would render Bryant inoperable for its intended purpose because Bryant teaches away from an O-ring that nearly fills the cross-sectional area of the groove as taught by Bertrem.  Reply Br. 4. We do not find these arguments persuasive.  As the Examiner correctly notes, Bryant is not the prior art invention being modified.  Ans. 6 \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007341 Application 12/380,154  5 (\\u201cBryant is not the reference being modified\\u201d).  Rather, as discussed supra, the Examiner proposes to modify AAPA in view of the teaching of Bryant.  Because Bryant is not being modified, the proposed modification does not change Bryant\\u2019s principle of operation or render it inoperable for its intended purpose. Appellants also argue that Bertrem, which discloses a groove 16 having a bottom 32 with a circular contour, teaches away from the claimed invention because \\u201cthe circular surface 32 is essential to the operation of [Bertrem] and a skilled artisan, after reading Bertrem, would not be led in the direction of providing a bottom wall, such as that now claimed that is parallel to the sealing surface.\\u201d  App. Br. 6; see also Reply Br. 3.   This argument is not persuasive because Bertrem is being relied on for teaching use of an O-ring having a cross-sectional area greater than that of its groove.  See Ans. 4, 6.  This teaching is not dependent on Bertrem\\u2019s curved bottom wall.  In other words, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the benefit of a greater O-ring cross-sectional area (i.e., more secure retention of the O-ring (see Bertrem, col. 1, ll. 49-52)) would also apply to grooves having a flat, non-curved bottom wall, such as shown by AAPA, the prior art being modified.  Furthermore, a reference does not teach away \\u201cif it merely expresses a general preference for an alternative invention but does not \\u2018criticize, discredit, or otherwise discourage\\u2019 investigation into the invention claimed.\\u201d  DePuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., 567 F.3d 1314, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting In re Fulton, 391 F.3d 1195, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  Here, Bertrem merely discloses a preference for a curved bottom wall (Bertrem, col. 2, ll. 28-30); \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007341 Application 12/380,154  6 Appellants do not identify any disclosure in Bertrem that \\u201ccriticizes, discredits, or otherwise discourages\\u201d use of a non-curved bottom wall. Appellants dispute the Examiner\\u2019s characterization of Bryant\\u2019s seal ring 36 as an \\u201cO-ring,\\u201d noting that the generally triangular cross-sectional shape of the seal ring 38 \\u201cis substantially different than an O-ring.\\u201d  Reply Br 2.  Appellants are apparently taking the position that the term \\u201cO-ring\\u201d refers to rings having only circular cross-sections, and excludes any rings having non-circular cross-sections.  However, we note that rather than simply reciting \\u201can O-ring\\u201d (as is done in independent claim 9), claim 1 recites an O-ring \\u201chaving a circular cross-section.\\u201d  This additional descriptive language would seem to suggest that the claim term \\u201cO-ring\\u201d is not intended to be limited to rings having circular cross-sections.  Otherwise, the language \\u201chaving a circular cross-section\\u201d would appear to be superfluous.  Furthermore, one of Appellants\\u2019 statements seems to acknowledge that Bryant\\u2019s seal ring 36 is an \\u201cO-ring.\\u201d  App. Br. 5 (stating the entire thrust of Bryant \\u201cis to provide a groove configured to receive an o-ring or sealing member so as to provide for the desired deflection of deformation of the o-ring\\u201d) (emphases added).  Nevertheless, assuming arguendo that Bryant\\u2019s seal ring 36 is not an \\u201cO-ring\\u201d as claimed and the Examiner has thus mischaracterized the seal ring, we do not find this to be persuasive that the Examiner\\u2019s rejection is in error because AAPA does show an O-ring 12 that clearly has a circular cross-section (Spec., figs. 2, 3) and the proposed modification does not alter the shape of the O-ring 12, but only the shape of the groove. We also disagree with Appellants\\u2019 argument that \\u201cthe Examiner has failed to give proper weight to the fact that Bryant teaches away from a \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007341 Application 12/380,154  7 combination with AAPA and Bertrem.\\u201d  Reply Br. 2.  Specifically, Appellants do not argue in their Appeal Brief that Bryant teaches away from the proposed combination.  Instead, as noted supra, Appellants argue that the proposed combination would change the principle of operation of Bryant.1  Furthermore, the argument that Bryant teaches away from the combination and the argument that the Examiner\\u2019s rejection \\u201cis based upon hindsight reconstruction\\u201d (Reply Br. 4) are both raised for the first time in Appellants\\u2019 Reply Brief.  As such, these arguments are deemed waived.  See Ex parte Borden, 93 USPQ2d 1473, 1477 (BPAI 2010) (informative) (\\u201cAny bases for asserting error, whether factual or legal, that are not raised in the principal brief are waived.\\u201d). For these reasons, Appellants\\u2019 arguments do not apprise us of error, and we sustain the rejection of claim 1.  Appellants rely on the same arguments made in connection with claim 1 in asserting the patentability of claim 9 (App. Br. 6) and do not present any additional arguments in connection with dependent claims 2-6, 8, and 10-12.  As such, claims 2-6 and 8-12 fall with claim 1.  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii) (2011). Rejection II Appellants do not address the rejection of claims 7, 13, and 14 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over AAPA, Bryant, Bertrem, and Hosokawa.

Moreover,\\nAppellant argues that an \\u201cinput method\\u201d includes using a computer\\nkeyboard to input characters, for example, according to the Chinese\\n\\nChangiei input method rules (Br. 7-l 0). We disagree with Appellant.Appeal 2011-002068\\nApplication 11/ 168,492\\nAppellant\\u2019s arguments regarding claim 1 are not persuasive because\\nthey are outside of the broader scope of claim 1. First, claim 1 does not\\nrequire input method rules because the claim recites, in the alternative,\\nintegrating a menu \\u201caccording to language input or input method rules.\\u201d\\nSecond, clai111 1 does not require a character option that corresponds to a\\nplurality of characters because the claim recites \\u201cfetching the contents of the\\ndesired character option,\\u201d where, in one case, the \\u201cfetched contents of the\\ndesired character option belongs to a character or a plurality of characters.\\u201d\\nThird, clai1n 1 does not recite using a computer keyboard to select character\\noptions or that the input method rules must correspond to Chinese Changjei\\nor any other particular input method.\\nWe are therefore not persuaded that the Examiner erred in rejecting\\n\\nclaim 1, and claims 6 and 9 not speci\\ufb01cally argued separately.\\n\\nClaim 3\\n\\nAppellant contends that Hsi \\u201cdoes not provide any function key of\\n\\u2018character option\\u2019 selection function as claimed by claim l(c)(i), nor provide\\nany function like claim 1(c\\u2018)(ii) which could cooperate the function of\\ncompletion of character option selection of input method\\u201d (Br. l0).\\n\\nAppellant\\u2019s arguments regarding clai111 3 are not persuasive because\\nthe claim does not require performing the argued function key steps of \\u201c(i)\\ncharacter option selection, wherein followed by performing step (d); (ii)\\ncompletion of character option selection. wherein followed by performing\\nstep (e)\\u201d as recited in claim 1, from which claim 3 depends.

However,\\nclaim 4 recites \\u201csaid character option is a single character, a single function\\nkey or a combination of a plurality of characters.\\u201d The character option is\\ndefined in the alternative, where \\u201ca plurality of characters\\u201d is one possible,\\nbut not required, de\\ufb01nition. Thus, Appellant\\u2019s argument that the references\\ndo not suggest a character option for a plurality of characters is outside the\\nbroader scope of claim 4, and therefore not persuasive.\\n\\nWe are therefore not persuaded that the Examiner erred in rejecting\\n\\nclaim 4.Appeal 2011-002068\\nApplication 11/ 168,492\\nClaim 5\\n\\nAppellant contends that \\u201cthe Examiner inconsistently interpreted the\\n\\u2018direction key\\u2019 between the independent clai111 and the dependent claim.\\nThe Examiner cited \\u2018arrow keys\\u2019 from a prior art as the teaching for the\\n\\u2018direction keys\\u2019 in the independent claim, but cited the \\u2018page keys\\u2019 from a\\ndifferent prior art as the teaching of the \\u2018direction keys\\u2019 in the current\\ndependent claim.\\u201d (Br. 13).\\n\\nClaim 5 recites that \\u201csaid direction keys or function keys are used to\\nselect each page and display one page at a time.\\u201d Accordingly, the paging\\nfeature of tl1e claimed invention can be operated by direction keys or\\nfunction keys, and does not require that direction keys be used. The\\nExaminer \\ufb01nds that Chang discloses a paging feature that relies on function\\nkeys (Ans. 7-8, 11). Appellant\\u2019s argument is not persuasive because it does\\nnot address the Examiner\\u2019s reliance on Chang\\u2019s function keys to meet the\\ndisputed limitation.\\n\\nWe are therefore not persuaded that the Examiner erred in rejecting\\n\\nclaim 5.\\n\\nClczims 7 and 8\\nAppellant contends that the combination of Chou and Hsi does not\\nteach the claimed invention (See Br. l l-12).

Therefore, we are not persuaded that theAppeal 2011-002068\\nApplication 11/ 168,492\\nExaminer erred in rejecting c1ai111s 7 and 8 because Appe1lant\\u2019s arguments\\n\\nare not responsive to the Examiner\\u2019s rejection.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\\nUnder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112, first paragraph, the Examiner erred in\\nrejecting claims 1 and 3-9.\\n\\nUnder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a), the Examiner did not err in rejecting claims\\n1 and 3-9.\\n\\nDECISION\\n\\nBecause we have affirmed at least one ground of rejection with\\nrespect to each claim on appeal, the Examiner\\u2019s decision is af\\ufb01mied.

DECISION ON APPEAL                                           1 Application filed October 31, 2005.  The real party in interest is General Electric Co.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006453 Application 11/264,192  2  STATEMENT OF THE CASE  Appellant seeks our review under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 of the Examiner\\u2019s final decision rejecting claims 1-32.  (App. Br. 2.)2  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We affirm. Appellant\\u2019s Invention  The invention at issue on appeal concerns systems and methods for controlling power flow of an electric power generation system by dissipating power and/or directing power to a compensating circuit.  (Spec. \\xb6\\xb6 [0001], [0007]-[0010]; Abstract.)   Representative Claim  Independent claim 1, reproduced below, with disputed limitations italicized, further illustrates the invention: 1.   A method for controlling power flow of an electric power generation system comprising:   generating or dissipating electric power to maintain a predetermined grid voltage and frequency;  transmitting the electric power to a grid;  sensing current and voltage of the electric power transmitted to the grid;  determining frequency of the grid and the power transmitted to the grid based on the sensed current and voltage; and  controlling a grid-side converter electrically coupled between a power generator and the grid to regulate the voltage                                            2 We refer to Appellant\\u2019s Specification (\\u201cSpec.\\u201d); Appeal Brief (\\u201cApp. Br.\\u201d) filed August 9, 2010; and Reply Brief (\\u201cReply Br.\\u201d) filed February 2, 2011.  We also refer to the Examiner\\u2019s Answer (\\u201cAns.\\u201d) mailed December 8, 2010. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006453 Application 11/264,192  3  and frequency of the grid via scheduling power flow to a compensating circuit when the sensed voltage is outside a desired voltage range or the determined frequency is outside a desired frequency range. Rejections on Appeal 1. The Examiner rejects claims 1-6, 8-19, and 21-32 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(e) as being anticipated by U.S. Patent. No. 7,233,129 B2, issued Jun. 19, 2007 (filed Nov. 3, 2004) (\\u201cErdman\\u201d). 2. The Examiner rejects claims 7 and 20 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Erdman and U.S. Patent App. Pub. No. 2005/0042098 A1, published Feb. 24, 2005 (\\u201cWobben\\u201d).  ISSUES Based on our review of the administrative record, Appellant\\u2019s contentions, and the Examiner\\u2019s findings and conclusions, the pivotal issues before us follow:  1. Does the Examiner finding that Erdman discloses \\u201csensing current and voltage of the electric power transmitted to the grid\\u201d and \\u201ccontrolling a grid-side converter electrically coupled between a power generator and the grid to regulate the voltage and frequency of the grid via scheduling power flow to a compensating circuit\\u201d within the meaning of claim 1 and the commensurate limitations of claim 17? 2. Does the Examiner finding that Erdman discloses \\u201csensing current and voltage of the electric power transmitted to the grid\\u201d and \\u201ccontrolling a grid-side converter electrically coupled between a power generator and the grid to regulate the voltage and frequency of the grid by \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006453 Application 11/264,192  4  reverting power flow in a power generator\\u201d within the meaning of claim 9 and the commensurate limitations of claim 29?  FINDINGS OF FACT We adopt the Examiner\\u2019s findings in the Answer and the Final Office Action mailed March 19, 2010 as our own, except as to those findings that we expressly overturn or set aside in the Analysis that follows.  ANALYSIS Based on Appellant\\u2019s arguments (App. Br. 5-9), we select independent claims 1 and 9 as representative of Appellant\\u2019s arguments and groupings with respect to claims 1-32.  37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii)(2004).  Claim 1 Appellant contends that Erdman not disclose the disputed features recited in claim 1.  (App. Br. 5-7; Reply Br. 2-3.)  Specifically, Appellant contends \\u201cthat Erdman does not disclose a current sensor, a compensating circuit and regulating the voltage and the frequency of the grid as in the pending claims.\\u201d  (App. Br. 6.)  Appellant also explains that the claimed compensating circuit, which includes a dump load resistor and dump load capacitor, is not disclosed by Erdman.  (App. Br. 6.)  Additionally, Appellant asserts that Erdman does not disclose a compensating circuit that is capable of (adapted to) dissipate power, nor regulating voltage and frequency of the grid.  (App. Br. 6-7.)    The Examiner sets forth a detailed explanation of the anticipation rejection in the Examiner\\u2019s Answer with respect to each of the claims so rejected (Ans. 3-13, 15-19), and in particular claim 1 (Ans. 3-5, 15-18).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006453 Application 11/264,192  5  Specifically, the Examiner provides a detailed explanation with respect to Erdman\\u2019s disclosure of a current sensor and current sensing, dissipating electric power, and regulating voltage and frequency of electric power transmitted to the grid.  (Ans. 3-6, 12-14 (citing Erdman, col. 6, ll. 43-48, 51-53, 66-67; col. 9, ll. 1-28; and U.S. Patent No. 5,083,039 (incorporated by reference in Erdman), col. 7, ll. 10-17).)  From these findings, the Examiner finds that Erdman anticipates Appellant\\u2019s claim 1.  (Ans. 3-5,  15-18.)  We adopt these findings and this reasoning as our own.   Upon consideration of the evidence on this record and each of Appellant\\u2019s contentions, we find that the preponderance of evidence on this record supports the Examiner\\u2019s findings and ultimate conclusion that Erdman anticipates the disputed features of claim 1.  Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1 for the reasons set forth in the Answer, which we incorporate herein by reference.  (Ans. 3-5, 15-18.)  Our additional analysis will be limited to the following points of emphasis.  As pointed out by the Examiner (Ans. 15-18), Appellant argues features not recited by the claim.  The claim recites \\u201csensing current and voltage of the electric power transmitted to the grid\\u201d and \\u201ccontrolling a grid-side converter electrically coupled between a power generator and the grid to regulate the voltage and frequency of the grid via scheduling power flow to a compensating circuit\\u201d (claim 1).  The claim does not recite a current sensor and reverting (dissipating) power (as recited in claim 17).  Nonetheless, as explained by the Examiner, U.S. Patent No. 5,083,039 (incorporated by reference in Erdman) discloses a current sensor and current sensing.  Further, Erdman describes at length a current regulated inverter and an inverter control circuit that outputs \\u201cvoltage and current at a frequency and \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006453 Application 11/264,192  6  phase angle appropriate for transmission to the utility grid\\u201d (col. 5, ll. 31-33) and includes a current sensor (current sensing) (col. 5, ll. 42-49) \\u2013 which we find discloses a current sensor and current sensing.  Further, Erdman describes dissipating power (col. 9, ll. 1-28) as discussed infra with respect to claim 9. With respect to \\u201ccontrolling a grid-side converter . . . to regulate the voltage and frequency of the grid via scheduling power flow to a compensating circuit\\u201d (claim 1), we note that the portion of the limitation \\u2013 \\u201cto regulate the voltage and frequency of the grid\\u201d \\u2013 argued by Appellant fails to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art either structurally or functionally.  Specifically, the recited feature essentially consists of a statement of intended use or purpose for the controlling functionality.  Such statements of intended purpose \\u201cusually will not limit the scope of the claim because such statements usually do no more than define a context in which the invention operates.\\u201d  Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc. v. Schering-Plough Corp., 320 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Even if we arguendo ascribe some patentable weight to the limitation, as explained by the Examiner (Ans. 18), Erdman discloses the result of \\u201cregulating\\u201d grid voltage and frequency by Erdman\\u2019s grid-side converter (inverter and inverter control circuit) controlling (reducing) power output to the grid during fault conditions by the converter routing power to the compensating circuit \\u2013 i.e., causing the generator system to absorb energy (power), either via the generator rotor (dissipation) or through storage (e.g., super-capacitors).  (Erdman, col. 9, ll. 1-28.)   Thus, Appellant does not persuade us of error in the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of representative independent claim 1, independent \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006453 Application 11/264,192  7  claim 17, dependent claims 2-6 and 8 (dependent on claim 1), and dependent claims 18, 19, and 21-28 (dependent on claim 17), not separately argued with particularity.  (App. Br. 9.)  Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of claims 1-6, 8, and 17-28. Claim 9 Appellant contends that Erdman not disclose the disputed features recited in claim 9.  (App. Br. 7-9; Reply Br. 3-4.)  Specifically, as with claim 1 (supra), Appellant contends that Erdman does not disclose a current sensor and regulating (\\u201cmaintaining\\u201d) the voltage and the frequency of the grid.  (App. Br. 8.)  Appellant further contend \\u201cErdman does not disclose . . . reverting power flow in a power generator as in the pending claims.\\u201d  (App. Br. 8.)     We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s findings with respect to the \\u201ccurrent sensor\\u201d (and \\u201csensing current\\u201d) and \\u201ccontrolling a grid-side converter . . . to regulate the voltage and frequency of the grid,\\u201d for the same reasons set forth with respect to claim 1 (supra).  We also find the Examiner correctly provides a detailed explanation with respect to Erdman\\u2019s disclosure of \\u201creverting\\u201d power.  (Ans. 7, 12, 18-19 (citing Erdman, col. 9, ll. 1-28.)  We adopt these findings and this reasoning as our own.   Erdman describes reverting (dissipating) power (col. 9, ll. 1-28) in that Erdman describes the inverter control circuit causing the voltage on the DC link to rise during a grid fault, which decreases the torque applied from the generator to the rotor causing the rotor to accelerate, which in turn causes energy to be absorbed (id.).  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s findings and broadly but reasonably construe \\u201creverting power flow\\u201d to read on Erdman\\u2019s disclosure of the generator absorbing energy.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-006453 Application 11/264,192  8  Thus, Appellant does not persuade us of error in the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of representative independent claim 9, independent claim 29, dependent claims 10-16 (dependent on claim 1), and dependent claims 30-32 (dependent on claim 29), not separately argued with particularity.  (App. Br. 9.)  Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s anticipation rejection of claims 9-16 and 29-32. The \\xa7 103 Rejection of Claims 7 and 20 Appellant does not separately argue with particularity the rejection of claims 7 and 20 under \\xa7 103.  (App. Br. 9.)  Accordingly, Appellant does not persuade us of error in the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection of dependent claims 7 and 20, and we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s obviousness rejection of these claims.

Claim 1 is representative and reads as follows (emphasis added): 1. A method, comprising: displaying at least a portion of a form; selecting a first field from the displayed portion of the form, wherein the first field is configured to receive data, and in response: associating a lens with the selected first field of the form; and  drawing the lens separate from the selected first field of the form, the lens comprising a first data entry area ready to receive the data for the selected first field of the form, wherein the selected first field of the form and the first data entry area of the lens are separate but simultaneously visible; receiving the data for the selected first field of the form into the first data entry area of the lens; and in response, entering the data received into the first data entry area of the lens into the selected first field of the form.  The claims stand rejected as follows:   I.

Claim 15 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Torres, FFHD and Borodovski.6  OPINION REJECTION I.\\u2014TORRES AND FFHD Issue The Examiner rejects claims 1, 4-8, 10-14, 16-18, 20-22, 25, and 26 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Torres and FFHD.  The Examiner finds that Torres discloses the method of claim 1 except that Torres fails to disclose \\u201cdrawing the lens separate from the selected first field of the form where the lens comprising a first data entry area ready to receive the data for the selected first field of the form\\u201d (Ans. 5).  The Examiner concludes that  It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of invention to combine the disclosures of Torres and FFHD as both inventions are related to providing assistance to users filling out forms.  Adding the disclosure of FFHD provides the benefit [of] a separate help window that contains both informational guidance about, as well as a copy of the selected form field and using that combination to assist the user in correctly filling out the form field.                                            4 Hui, US 7,429,993 B2, issued Sept. 30, 2008.  5 Ladd, et al., PLATINUM EDITION USING HTML 4, XML, AND JAVA 1.2, (Que, 1998). 6 Borodovski et al., US 2004/0205526 A1, published Oct. 14, 2004.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  4  (Id. at 6.) Appellants contend that  When a user of Torres selects an input field, the guidance text window responsively appears beside the selected input field, and remains there while the user types into the input field. The user never makes an entry into the guidance text window.  FFHD does not draw the separate lens in response to selection of the field configured to receive data, as recited in claim 1. Instead, FFHD draws the separate lens in response to selection of a separate \\u201cHelp?\\u201d link, not in response to selection of the \\u201cUser Name\\u201d or \\u201cPassword\\u201d field. Thus, neither Torres nor FFHD teaches drawing a separate lens containing a data entry area in response to selection of a field configured to receive data.  (App. Br. 11; see also, Reply Br. 3.)  The issue presented is:  Does the evidence of record support the Examiner\\u2019s finding that the combination of Torres and FFHD teaches or suggests a method having all elements of Appellants\\u2019 claims?   Findings of Fact The following findings of fact (\\u201cFF\\u201d) are supported by a preponderance of the evidence of record. FF1.

FF3. Torres discloses that \\u201c[a]s the cursor is moved to different fields in the form, a guidance text window will be displayed above the selected field and will contain extended text information helpful and/or necessary to the user in filling-in the information required to be input to the current or selected field\\u201d (id.).  FF4. FFHD may be accessed at http://web.archive.org/web/20050121052313/http://javascript.internet.com/forms/form-field-help.html.  FF5. When the FFHD is operated by a user, a blinking cursor appears in the selected \\u201cUser Name\\u201d or \\u201cPassword\\u201d field and the user is allowed to enter data directly into the selected field.  FF6. A separate window for entering data into the \\u201cUser Name\\u201d or \\u201cPassword\\u201d field opens when the user selects the separate \\u201cHelp?\\u201d link adjacent to the \\u201cUser Name\\u201d or \\u201cPassword\\u201d field in original window.  The separate window includes a single field to enter the \\u201cUser Name\\u201d or \\u201cPassword,\\u201d depending on which \\u201cHelp?\\u201d link was selected.  The \\u201cUser Name\\u201d or \\u201cPassword\\u201d fields in the separate window and original window are simultaneously visible on the screen.  When the user enters data into the field of the separate window, the fields in the separate window and original window are populated with identical data.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  7  Principles of Law \\u201c[A] patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was, independently, known in the prior art.\\u201d  KSR Int\\u2019l v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007).  However, a prima facie conclusion of obviousness may be supported by a showing that a combination of familiar elements according to known methods yields no more than predictable results.  Id. at 401; citing United States v. Adams, 383 U.S. 39, 50-52 (1966).  Furthermore, the Supreme Court has emphasized that \\u201cthe [obviousness] analysis need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim, for a court can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ.\\u201d Id. at 418.  \\u201cIf a person of ordinary skill can implement a predictable variation, \\xa7 103 likely bars its patentability.\\u201d  Id. at 417.   Analysis Claims 1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, and 22 Torres provides a lens (FF1, element 311) associated with a first field (FF1, element 307) and the Examiner contends that it would have been obvious to modify Torres\\u2019s lens to function as a separate window and to include a data entry field as disclosed in FFHD (see Ans. 6).  The Examiner has provided a rational basis for combining the cited references, where the proposed modifications address each disputed element of claim 1 and are supported by the findings of fact.  Appellants have not presented any scientific reasoning or evidence to establish that the references are incapable of being combined as set forth by the Examiner to achieve the method of claim 1.  We thus find that the Examiner has expressed a proper reason for \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  8  the combination of the cited references, namely, the combination of familiar elements in a manner that yields no more than predictable results.  KSR, 550 U.S. at 401. Appellants\\u2019 argument that the combination of references fails to teach selecting or activating a form input field is flawed as it only considers the action of the \\u201cHelp?\\u201d link disclosed in FFHD.  Torres\\u2019 lens is activated by selecting the form input field (FF1- FF2), and the modification of this lens with a data entry field as used in the separate window of FFHD (FF5-FF6) would have resulted in a lens having a data entry area ready to receive the data for the selected field of the form.  We agree with the Examiner that Appellants have failed to fully address the teachings of the references in combination.  See In re Merck & Co. Inc., 800 F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Each reference \\u201cmust be read, not in isolation, but for what it fairly teaches in combination with the prior art as a whole.\\u201d).  We are therefore not persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 arguments to the contrary.   Appellants further argue that the Examiner has failed to establish that FFHD is a prior art reference (App. Br. 17-19).  In contesting the Examiner\\u2019s reliance on this document, Appellants argue that, \\u201cper the explicit terms of use for the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, the January 21, 2005 archive is not guaranteed to be accurate, current, complete, reliable, secure or error-free\\u201d (id. at 18).   Appellants\\u2019 contentions are not persuasive. First, MPEP \\xa7 2128 provides guidance that \\u201c[p]rior art disclosures on the Internet or on an on-line database are considered to be publicly available as of the date the item was publicly posted.\\u201d  Electronic documents are archived on the Wayback \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  9  Machine and are dated as of the archived date of the website.7  Appellants do not indicate that the archive date provided for FFHD by the Wayback Machine was generated other than in the normal course of operation of this site. There is no indication that this date was arbitrarily assigned or that the origin of document itself is suspect.  Second, we have been instructed that \\u201c[t]he general rule is that administrative agencies like the PTO are not bound by the rules of evidence that govern judicial proceedings.\\u201d In re Epstein, 32 F.3d 1559, 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  Accordingly, without more, we decline to agree with Appellants that reliance by the Examiner on FFHD was improper. For the reasons above, we find that the preponderance of the evidence of record supports the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that the combined teachings of the cited prior art disclose a method having all limitations of independent claim 1.  Claims 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, and 22 are not argued separately and fall with claim 1.  37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii).   Dependent claims 4, 17, 20, and 25 Claim 4 requires \\u201cassociating the lens with the second field of the form in response to the entering the data into the first field of the form, and in response: redrawing the lens to comprise a second data entry area, wherein the second field of the form and the second data entry area of the lens are simultaneously visible . . . .\\u201d                                            7 \\u201cElectronic documents that are not themselves dated and have no posting date, but are/were available as links on a website that is archived on the Wayback Machine, are dated as of the archived date of the website.\\u201d See Prior art in the Field of Business Method Patents -- When is an Electronic Document a printed Publication for Prior Art Purposes?  Presented at AIPLA Fall 2002 by Wynn W. Coggins, The United States Patent and Trademark Office.  Also found at http://www.uspto.gov/patents/resources/methods/aiplafall02paper.jsp. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  10  Appellants argue that  [I]t is abundantly clear that in Torres, associating a lens with a second field of the form only occurs in response to the user selecting the second field itself for input.  In clear contrast, Appellant\\u2019s claim 4 recites that the lens is associated with the second field of the form in response to entering the data into the first field of the form, not, as in Torres, in response to selecting a second field for input.  (App. Br. 20; emphasis omitted.)   We are not persuaded.  Rather, we agree with the Examiner that the claim terms \\u201centering the data\\u201d are reasonably interpreted to encompass the user\\u2019s completion of data entry (see Ans. 31-32).  For example, the user may move on to the second form field by typing the \\u201cEnter\\u201d key after entering data into the first form field (cf. Spec. 16-17, \\xb6 [0045]).  We further agree with the Examiner that Torres discloses this functionality.  Specifically, the Examiner correctly finds that  Torres chooses to advance to the next input field through user interaction, where, having completed filling the current input field, the user selects or enters the next input field causing the focus to change from the current input field to the next input field and producing a \\u2018lens\\u2019 for the next input field to be displayed  (Ans. 32; cf. FF3).  Accordingly, we find no error in the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that the combination of Torres and FFHD teaches all elements of claim 4.  Claims 17, 20, and 25 fall with claim 4.   Dependent claims 7, 8, 21, and 26 Claim 7 further requires \\u201cdrawing a widget adjacent to the lens.\\u201d  The Examiner finds that Torres discloses the use of Work Aids 920 that are considered by the Examiner to be equivalent to widgets (id. at 11).   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  11  Appellants contend that \\u201cTorres does not indicate that [widgets] are drawn adjacent to the extended text window, but rather, that they are drawn within the extended text window\\u201d (App. Br. 21).   We find no error in the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that claim 7 is a prima facie case of obviousness over the combination of Torres and FFHD.  We sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection for the reasons set forth in the Answer, which we incorporate herein by reference (Ans. 11 and 32-33).  Claims 8, 21, and 26 fall with claim 7.   Dependent claim 12 Claim 12 further requires \\u201credrawing the form so that the form appears to have moved.\\u201d The Examiner finds that \\u201cthe transitions between Figures 3 and 4 and Figures 7 and 8 [of Torres] shows a re-drawing of \\u2018the form\\u2019 such that the surrounding fields \\u2018move\\u2019 to give room for the drawn lens\\u201d (Ans. 14).   Appellants argue that, \\u201c[e]ven if the Examiner\\u2019s assertion is taken for granted, it only suggests that fields within the form appear to have moved, not that the form itself appears to have moved, as recited in claim 12\\u201d (App. Br. 21). We find no error in the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that claim 12 is a prima facie case of obviousness over the combination of Torres and FFHD. We sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection for the reasons set forth in the Answer, which we incorporate herein by reference (Ans. 14 and 32-33).   Dependent claim 16  Claim 16 depends from claim 14 and further requires \\u201cthe help information further comprises both a title of the first field and information about filling in the first field.\\u201d  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  12  We find no error in the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that claim 16 is a prima facie case of obviousness over the combination of Torres and FFHD. Accordingly, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection for the reasons set forth in the Answer, which we incorporate herein by reference (Ans. 14-18 and 34-35).   Conclusion of Law The preponderance of the evidence of record supports the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that the combined teachings of the cited prior art disclose a method having all limitations of Appellants\\u2019 claims.     REJECTION II.\\u2014TORRES, FFHD, AND HUI The Examiner rejected claims 2, 19, and 23 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Torres, FFHD, and Hui.  Claim 2 is representative and provides as follows:  2. The method of claim 1, further comprising drawing the lens with reduced opacity to give it a translucent or transparent appearance such that a portion of the form covered by the lens remains visible.  The Examiner finds that both Torres and FFHD fail to disclose the feature of claim 2, but finds that Hui  discloses a transparent (i.e. reduced opacity) spreadsheet help screen (i.e. \\u201clens\\u201d) that allows a user to see through the help screen to the content below (spreadsheet cells) and to also interact with the content underneath the help screen. This particular help screen also contains a form input for the user to enter what they need help with (see at least Figures 2A-B, compare with prior art Figures 1A-B).   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  13  (Ans. 20.)  The Examiner concludes that \\u201c[a]dding the disclosure of Hui to that of Torres and FFHD provides the user with a lens which, in addition to features provided by the combination of Torres with FFHD also provides the user with an unobscured view of underlying content\\u201d (id.; emphasis omitted).   Appellants contend that  Torres does not benefit from Hui\\u2019s \\u201cfunctional transparency\\u201d because Torres\\u2019s guidance text window does not obscure the field in focus. Regarding FFHD, in direct contrast to Hui, when FFHD\\u2019s user selects the \\u201cHelp?\\u201d link, the focus automatically shifts to a new, separate help window in which the user enters data for the field for which the help window is chosen. Since FFHD\\u2019s user enters data directly into the new, separate help window itself, there is no benefit in having it be \\u201cfunctionally transparent.\\u201d Moreover, the new, separate help window generated in FFHD does not cover the field for which it was chosen.  In fact, the user can even reset the reset the focus to the original field without ever moving the new, separate help window generated for the original field. Thus, neither Torres nor FFHD gains any \\u201cbenefit of an obstructed view of the underlying content\\u201d by \\u201cadding the disclosure of Hui.\\u201d  (App. Br. 23.)   This argument is not persuasive.  As discussed above, Torres discloses the feature of a \\u201clens\\u201d that is activated when a user selects an input field on a form and FFHD discloses a \\u201clens\\u201d (separate window) with a separate input field.  Hui discloses a \\u201clens\\u201d that does not obscure the field of focus (Hui at Figures 2A-B).  Appellants\\u2019 arguments address features missing from each of the individual references, but fail to address the references as combined by the Examiner.  The Examiner has set forth a prima facie conclusion of obviousness by showing that the prior art teaches the elements of claim 2. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  14  Appellants have provided no evidence or persuasive reasoning to show that the cited references do not enable a skilled worker to produce the claimed method or that the Examiner\\u2019s proposed combination yields more than predictable results.  According, we find Appellants have not adequately rebutted Examiner\\u2019s prima facie case of obviousness.   Conclusion of Law The preponderance of the evidence of record supports the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that the combined teachings of the cited prior art disclose a method having all limitations of claim 2.  Claims 19 and 23 are not argued separately and fall with claim 2.    REJECTION III.\\u2014TORRES, FFHD, AND LADD The Examiner rejected claims 9 and 27 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Torres, FFHD, and Ladd.  Appellants argue that these claims are patentable without providing additional argument or evidence (App. Br. 24; Reply Br. 19).  Thus, for the same reasons discussed above, Appellants\\u2019 arguments do not persuade us that the Examiner has erred in concluding that claims 9 and 27 are unpatentable over the combination of Torres, FFHD, and Ladd.  REJECTION IV.\\u2014TORRES, FFHD, AND BORODOVSKI The Examiner rejected of claim 15 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Torres, FFHD and Borodovski.  Claim 15 provides as follows:  15. The method of claim 14, wherein the drawing the lens further comprises drawing a navigation arrow to enable a user to navigate the form. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  15   The Examiner finds that both Torres and FFHD fail to disclose the feature of claim 15, but finds that Borodovski \\u201cteaches a navigational arrow that directs a user to which field of a form to fill in according to a sequence, thereby enabling the user to navigate the form by directing them to a particular form field at a particular time and sequence (see Pg. 2, Paragraph [0021]; Figure 1)\\u201d (Ans. 23).  Indeed, Borodovski discloses that the use of a navigation arrow to visually indicated that a field needs to be populated.  The Examiner concludes that \\u201c[a]dding the disclosure of Borodovski to that of Torres and FFHD provides the benefit of assisting the user with form navigation by directing them according to a particular filling sequence\\u201d (id.).    Appellants contend that  Modifying Torres with Borodovski would defeat Torres\\u2019s fundamental aim of allowing the user to easily verify and visually confirm, before shifting focus to the next field, that the user has correctly keyed in the data for the current form field [see 0029], in order to avoid \\u201cspending an unnecessary amount of wasted time in extra work steps, redoing inputs, excessive window management and manipulation, and needless errors due to short term memory limitations [Torres, 0004].\\u201d Hence, the proposed modification is counter to Torres\\u2019s intended purpose and principle of operation.  (Reply Br. 20.)   We are not persuaded.  \\u201cA change in the basic principles\\u201d refers to change that is fundamental in scope to the scientific or technical principles under which the invention is designed to operate.  In re Ratti, 270 F.2d 810, 813 (CCPA 1959) (\\u201cThis suggested combination of references would require a substantial reconstruction and redesign of the elements shown in [the primary reference] as well as a change in the basic principles under which \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  16  the [primary reference] construction was designed to operate.\\u201d). It cannot be said that \\u201cchange in the basic principles\\u201d occurs by all modifications of a prior art device which changes the manner in which the device operates. Otherwise, even nominal modification to a prior art device could be considered a \\u201cchange in the basic principles,\\u201d thereby eliminating the need for obviousness analysis under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103.   We find no evidence of record suggesting that the device suggested by the combination of references is incapable of operating in the manner set forth by the Examiner.  The Examiner relies on Borodovski for the teaching of a navigation arrow to enable a user to navigate the form.  Appellants\\u2019 arguments are directed to the specific context in which the arrow is used by Borodovski, not the manner in which the arrow would be used in the context of the combination of references.  We find no error in the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that claim 15 is a prima facie case of obviousness over the combination of Torres and FFHD.   SUMMARY We affirm the rejection of claims 1, 4-8, 10-14, 16-18, 20-22 and 25-26 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Torres and FFHD. We affirm the rejection of claims 2, 19, and 23 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Torres, FFHD, and Hui.  We affirm the rejection of claims 9 and 27 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Torres, FFHD, and Ladd.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007925 Application 11/494,180  17  We affirm the rejection of claim 15 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over the combination of Torres, FFHD and Borodovski.

We have\\njurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b). Claim 1 is illustrative:\\n\\nl. A method for forming an electrical assembly, comprising:\\n\\nproviding multiple electronic devices with primary faces where\\n\\nelectrical contacts are located, opposed rear faces, and edges extending\\nbetween the primary and rear faces;Appeal 2011-05513\\nApplication ll/372,666\\n\\nproviding a perforated warp control sheet having multiple openings\\ntherein sized to accept the multiple electronic devices and having a first\\ncoefficient of thermal expansion (CTE);\\n\\nproviding a temporary support adapted to receive the multiple\\nelectronic devices and the perforated warp control sheet on a principal\\nsurface thereof;\\n\\nthen in either order, placing the perforated warp control sheet and the\\nmultiple electronic devices on the principal surface of the temporary support,\\nwith the multiple electronic devices in the openings in the perforated warp\\ncontrol sheet so that gaps are located between the edges of the electronic\\ndevices and edges of the openings in the perforated warp control sheet, and\\nwherein the primary faces of the electronic devices are oriented toward the\\nprincipal surface of the temporary support;\\n\\nproviding plastic encapsulation material at least in the gaps, wherein a\\ncharacteristic of the plastic encapsulation material is that a second CTE of\\nthe plastic encapsulation material is equal or greater than the first CTE;\\n\\ncuring the plastic encapsulation material, wherein the characteristic\\nthat the second CTE is equal to or greater than the \\ufb01rst CTE results, after\\ncuring, in a panel containing the multiple electronic devices and the\\nperforated warp control sheet having a convex warp wherein a \\ufb01rst surface\\nof the panel at which the primary faces are exposed has a convex curve; and\\n\\nseparating the devices, the perforated warp control sheet and the\\nplastic encapsulation in the gaps froin the temporary support, thereby\\nproviding the panel containing the multiple electronic devices and the\\nperforated warp control sheet joined by the plastic encapsulation.\\n\\nThe Examiner relies upon the following references as evidence of\\n\\nobviousness:\\n\\nShin et al. (Shin) 6,717,248 B2 Apr. 6, 2004\\nShinohara et al. (Shinohara) US 2003/0094682 A1 May 22, 2003\\nDerederian et al.

(Eichelberger) US 2005/0158009 A1 Jul. 21, 2005\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 claimed invention is directed to a method for forming an\\nelectrical assembly comprising providing a perforated warp control sheet\\nwith multiple openings therein over multiple electronic devices having\\nelectrical contacts on their rear faces. A plastic encapsulation material is\\nprovided in gaps between the edges of tlie electronic devices and the edges\\nof the openings in the warp control sheet. The encapsulation material has a\\ncoefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is equal to or greater than the\\nCTE of the warp control sheet. Curing the encapsulation material results in\\nthe panel containing the multiple electronic devices and the perforated warp\\ncontrol sheet having a convex warp such that the first surface of the panel at\\nwhich the primary faces are exposed has a convex curve.\\n\\nAppealed claims 1-13, 15, 16, 21, and 22 stand rejected under\\n35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a\\u201c) as being unpatentable over Shin in view of Eichelberger,\\nDerderian, and Shinohara. Claim 14 stands rejected under 35 U.S.C.\\n\\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over the stated combination of references\\nfurther in view of Egitto.\\n\\nWe l1aVe thoroughly reviewed the respective positions advanced by\\nAppellants and the Examiner. In so doing, we \\ufb01nd ourselves in agreement\\nwitl1 Appellants that the Examiner\\'s conclusion of obviousness for the\\nclaimed subject matter is not supported by the cited prior art. Accordingly,\\nwe will not sustain the Examiner\\'s rejections.\\n\\nThe Examiner recognizes that Shin, the primary reference, fails to\\n\\ndisclose that the primary faces of the electronic devices are oriented towardAppeal 2011-05513\\nApplication ll/372,666\\n\\nthe principal surface of the temporary support and that the CTE of the plastic\\nencapsulation material is equal to or greater than the CTE of the warp\\ncontrol sheet. The Examiner cites Derderian for teaching that a plastic\\nencapsulation material has a CTE that is equal to or greater than the CTE of\\na substrate wafer. However, as stressed by Appellants, the Examiner has not\\nrefuted Appellants\\u2019 argument that Derderian does not disclose the claimed\\nperforated warp control sheet and plastic encapsulation material, but, rather,\\nreinforcement mate\\ufb01al bonded to a wafer backside surface. Also, Derderian\\nemploys the reinforcement material to prevent warping rather than for111ing\\nthe claimed convex warp and convex curve.\\n\\nThe Examiner appreciates that Derderian fails to disclose \"the\\nperforated warp control sheet having a convex warp wherein a \\ufb01rst surface\\nof the panel at which the primary faces are exposed l1as a convex curVe\"\\n(Ans. 6, first paraj), and cites Shinohara for teaching a perforated warp\\ncontrol sheet having a convex warp, etc. However, the Examiner has not\\nrefuted Appellants\\u2019 argument that Shinohara fails to disclose a perforated\\nwarp control sheet and panel having a convex curve, but \"merely discloses a\\ncurved insulating substrate that is intended for incorporation into a larger\\nassembly\" (Prin. Br. 16, first para.\\u201c). In particular, the Examiner has not\\nrebutted Appellants\\u2018 position that \"[t]he insulating substrate [of Shinohara] is\\nnot analogous to a \\u2018perforated warp control sheet\\u2018, and the assembly of\\nShinohara does not include any electronic devices having exposed primary\\nfaces proximate a convexly curved surface of a panel\" (1a\\u2019.).\\n\\nIn addition, the Examiner l1as not rebutted Appellants\\u2019 argument that\\n\\nwhereas the claimed method results in an assembly wherein the primaryAppeal 2011-05513\\nApplication ll/372,666\\n\\nfaces comprise elect\\ufb01cal contacts that are exposed in the \\ufb01nal assembly,\\nShin, in contrast, has the faces of chips 2, to wl1icl1 the electrical contacts 6\\nare connected, completely covered by encapsulate 20 in order to protect the\\nchips from the external environment (see Shin at col. 14, lines 42-45).\\n\\nIn essence, it is our judgment that the Examiner\\'s proposed\\nmodi\\ufb01cation of Shin results fro111 a hindsight reconstruction based on\\nAppellants\\u2019 disclosure rather than the teachings and suggestions that one of\\nordinary skill in the art would have gleaned from the cited prior art.\\n\\nln conclusion, based on the foregoing, we are constrained to reverse\\nthe Examiner\\'s rejections.\\n\\nRE VERSED\\n\\nC 3111'},\n",

Ans., p. 9 (\\u201cclient device 302 can build the Web page structure\\nafter using the expansion function 416\\u201d). Appellants argue that\\nMcCartney\\u2019s client 302 instead renders an HTML webpage in accord witl1\\nthe HTML code, stating:\\n\\nlnstead of rendering data in accordance with layout data\\nincluded at a prior installation of a displayed user interface, the\\ncited portion of McCartney (ll 77) explains that Web pages are\\ndisplayed based on web page structure 404 provided with each\\nweb page. As such, each web page in McCartney is displayed\\naccording to the web page structure 404 received with the Web\\npage, as opposed to previously-installed layout data.\\n\\nApp. Br., p. 6 (emphasis omitted).\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 argument fails to acknowledge that McCartney\\u2019s client\\n302 renders a webpage in accord with not only the expansion function\\nidenti\\ufb01er located within the webpage\\u2019s HTML code (e.g., \\u201c@\\u201d), but also in\\naccord with the corresponding expansion function 416 already known to the\\nclient 302 before receipt of the webpage. See supra, p. 3, \\u201cApplied Prior\\nArt.\\u201d\\n\\nNonetheless, Appellants\\u2019 argument is persuasive insofar that the\\nExaminer has not presented a suf\\ufb01cient basis to find that the expansion\\nfunction 416 is included at installation of a user interface on the client 302.\\nThe Examiner finds that \\u201c[c]lient device 302  clearly has [an] operating\\nsyste111 826, one or more application programs 828, other program modules\\n830, and program data 832 (or some combination thereof), which may\\n\\ninclude embodiments of logical semantic compression already \\u2018installed\\u2019Appeal 201 l-006540\\n\\nApplication ll/229,980\\n\\ninside client device 302.\\u201d Ans., p. ll (citing McCartney, 1] [0098] and\\n[0l03]; Fig. 8). Contrary to this contention, McCartney\\u2019s cited disclosures\\nteach only that the expansion function 416 (\\u201clogical semantic compression\\u201d)\\ncan be: expressed by various types of data structures such as application\\nmodules, program modules, etc.; and stored by various types of data\\nmediums such as ROM, RAM, etc. McCartney, 1] [0098] and [0103].\\nThough McCartney\\u2019s client 302 could indeed utilize these types of data\\nstructures and mediums, McCartney\\u2019s cited disclosures fall short of teaching\\nthat the expansion function 416 is accordingly included at installation of a\\nuser interface on the client 302.

HANLON, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007962 Application 11/927,834   2  A. STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Appellant has filed an appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 from an Examiner\\u2019s decision finally rejecting claims 1-18 and 26-31.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We REVERSE and enter new grounds of rejection. The subject matter on appeal is directed to a process for making propylene comprising, inter alia, bypassing a first product around an existing etherification reactor for converting isobutylene to methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). According to the Appellant\\u2019s Specification: MTBE production has decreased as various jurisdictions restricted or banned its use.  By late 2006 most American gasoline retailers stopped using MTBE as an oxygenate.  Accordingly, domestic production has continued to decline.  As a result, MTBE manufacturers are left holding useless feedstocks and manufacturing assets.  There is a need, therefore, for reallocating feedstocks and manufacturing assets previously allocated to the manufacture of MTBE, thereby providing an economic benefit to MTBE manufacturers. Spec., \\xb6\\xb6 [0003]-[0004]. The Appellant\\u2019s process reallocates MTBE feedstocks and manufacturing assets to produce olefins such as propylene.  Spec., \\xb6 [0010]. Representative claim 1 is reproduced below from the Claims Appendix of the Appeal Brief dated January 17, 2012 (\\u201cApp. Br.\\u201d). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007962 Application 11/927,834   3  1. A process for making propylene, comprising:  [1] dehydrogenating a feed comprising one or more C4-containing compounds to provide a first product comprising about 20 vol% to about 80 vol% isobutylene;  [2] bypassing the first product comprising about 20 vol% to about 80 vol% isobutylene around an existing etherification reactor for converting isobutylene to methyl tert-butyl ether; and   [3] cracking at least a portion of the first product comprising about 20 vol% to about 80 vol% isobutylene to provide a second product comprising propylene, ethylene, and butane, wherein cracking comprises contacting the first product with a catalyst consisting essentially of a zeolite at reaction conditions favoring conversion of the first product to propylene. The claims stand rejected as follows:1 (1) claims 1-18, 26, 27, and 29-31 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Leyshon (U.S. 5,043,522 issued Aug. 27, 1991) in view of Hensley (U.S. 5,254,748 issued Oct. 19, 1993) and Tsunoda (U.S. 6,307,117 B1 issued Oct. 23, 2001);2 and  (2) claim 28 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Leyshon in view of Hensley, Tsunoda, and Miracca (U.S. 5,446,224 issued Aug. 29, 1995).    The Appellant presents separate arguments for claims 1 and 29 in the Appeal Brief.                                                  1 In the Examiner\\u2019s Answer dated February 24, 2012 (\\u201cAns.\\u201d), at 18, the Examiner withdrew the obviousness-type double patenting rejection of claims 1-18 and 26-31 as unpatentable over claims 1-12 and 23-30 of Application 11/927,828. 2 Claim 31 was not included in the statement of the rejection in the Final Office Action dated August 2, 2011 (\\u201cFinal\\u201d), at 2.  However, the Examiner discusses claim 31 in the body of the rejection.  Final 6.  For the reasons set forth infra, this rejection is not sustained.  Thus, it is not necessary to determine whether the Examiner\\u2019s error was harmful. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007962 Application 11/927,834   4  B. EXAMINER\\u2019S REJECTIONS UNDER 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a)  The Examiner finds Leyshon discloses a process for producing propylene comprising the step of dehydrogenating a feed comprising C4+ products.  The Examiner finds Leyshon does not disclose the bypassing and cracking steps recited in claim 1.  Ans. 4-5.   The Examiner finds Hensley discloses a process which integrates dehydrogenating C4 compounds with a MTBE unit and concludes that it would have been obvious to combine the dehydrogenation reactor of Leyshon with the MTBE unit disclosed in Hensley and \\u201cmake an integrated process of dehydrogenation and etherification.\\u201d  Id. at 5.   As for the cracking step, the Examiner finds Tsunoda discloses a method of producing ethylene, propylene, and butane by direct cracking of C4+ olefins.  Id.  The Examiner finds \\u201cethylene and propylene are important raw materials for a variety of products.\\u201d  Id. at 6.  Thus, the Examiner concludes it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to introduce an olefin cracking step in the modified Leyshon process to produce ethylene and propylene \\u201cwhen MTBE is not a desired product\\u201d thereby bypassing the MTBE unit disclosed in Hensley.  Id.   The Appellant argues that \\u201c[n]othing about Hensley motivates or suggests bypassing its etherification unit because the etherification unit is a key component of Hensley\\u2019s \\u2018essential feature.\\u2019\\u201d  App. Br. 11.  The Appellant\\u2019s argument is supported by the record.  See Hensley, col. 3, ll. 24-28 (\\u201cAn essential feature of all the disclosed embodiments of the present invention is directed to integrating a combination hydrogenation/dehydrogenation step . . . into an etherification process.\\u201d).  Thus, absent the Appellant\\u2019s disclosure, there would have been no reason to bypass the MTBE reactor disclosed in Hensley and introduce an olefin \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007962 Application 11/927,834   5  cracking step as proposed by the Examiner.  For this reason, the \\xa7 103(a) rejection based on Leyshon in view of Hensley and Tsunoda is not sustained.   The Examiner does not rely on Miracca to overcome the above-noted deficiency in Hensley.  Therefore, the \\xa7 103(a) rejection based on Leyshon in view of Hensley, Tsunoda, and Miracca is not sustained.   C. NEW GROUNDS OF REJECTION Claims 1-18, 26, 27, and 29-31 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Tsunoda, Hensley, and  paragraphs [0003] and [0004] of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification.  1. Claim 1 There is no dispute on this record that Tsunoda discloses a method of producing ethylene, propylene, and butane by cracking C4+ olefins.  Ans. 5; see also Tsunoda, col. 12, ll. 14-15 (ethylene and propylene are collected from the obtained H2-C3 fraction); Tsunoda, col. 12, ll. 38-48 (butane is separated by the C4 separator).  In one embodiment, Tsunoda discloses that the hydrocarbon feedstock is a C4 fraction comprised mainly of C4 hydrocarbons, such as butane, isobutane, butene, and isobutene.  Tsunoda, col. 11, ll. 61-67.  Thus, we find Tsunoda discloses step [3] of the claimed process.   As for step [1] of the claimed process, Hensley discloses a method of producing tertiary alkyl ether compounds, such as MTBE, from a mixture of C4 hydrocarbons.  Hensley, col. 4, ll. 51-55.  According to one embodiment of the invention, a mixed C4 hydrocarbon feed stream is provided to a hydrogenation/dehydrogenation unit along with an isobutane stream from an isomerization unit.  Id. at col. 5, ll. 56-62.  Hensley discloses that the reaction product from the hydrogenation/de-hydrogenation unit comprises primarily \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007962 Application 11/927,834   6  isobutene but also contains significant amounts of butene-1, butene-2, n-butane, and isobutane.  Id. at col. 4, l. 67-col. 5, l. 2 and col. 5, ll. 52-54.   The reaction product from the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation unit of Hensley is substantially the same as the hydrocarbon feedstock used in the method of Tsunoda.  Thus, we find one of ordinary skill in the art would have considered Hensley\\u2019s reaction product to be a suitable feedstock in Tsunoda\\u2019s method.   As for step [2] of the claimed process, Hensley discloses that the reaction product from the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation unit feeds a distillation column, and the overhead from the distillation unit is fed to a MTBE unit.  Id. at col. 5, l. 63-col. 6, l. 2.   The Appellant discloses that MTBE production was on the decline at the time of the Appellant\\u2019s invention and \\u201cMTBE manufacturers are left holding useless feedstocks and manufacturing assets.\\u201d  Spec., \\xb6 [0003].  Thus, according to the Appellant, \\u201c[t]here is a need . . . for reallocating feedstocks and manufacturing assets previously allocated to the manufacture of MTBE, thereby providing an economic benefit to MTBE manufacturers.\\u201d  Id. at \\xb6 [0004].    Based on this disclosure in the Appellant\\u2019s Specification, we find one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to reallocate Hensley\\u2019s MTBE feedstocks and manufacturing assets (i.e., Hensley\\u2019s hydrogenation/de-hydrogenation unit) to produce the feedstock in Tsunoda\\u2019s method.  This combination results in step [2] of the claimed process (i.e., bypassing Hensley\\u2019s reaction product from the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation unit around an existing etherification reactor).  Thus, we conclude the process of claim 1 is rendered obvious by the combination of Tsunoda, Hensley, and paragraphs [0003] and [0004] of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007962 Application 11/927,834   7    2. Claim 29  Claim 29 recites, inter alia, that \\u201cthe feed further comprises about 70% vol or more isobutane and about 5% vol to about 30% vol butane.\\u201d  App. Br., Claims App\\u2019x.  The Appellant argues Leyshon does not \\u201cteach, show, or suggest a feed comprising about 70% vol or more isobutane and about 5% vol to about 30% vol butane, as required in claim 29.\\u201d  Id. at 15.    We find Hensley teaches that the concentration of isobutane in the feed stream is a result effective variable.  Hensley, col. 4, ll. 51-59; see also In re Boesch, 617 F.2d 272, 276 (CCPA 1980) (\\u201cdiscovery of an optimum value of a result effective variable in a known process is ordinarily within the skill of the art\\u201d).  Thus, the burden shifts to the Appellant to demonstrate that a feed comprising \\u201cabout 70% vol or more isobutane\\u201d achieves unexpectedly good results.  See In re Antonie, 559 F.2d 618, 620 (CCPA 1977) (a prima facie case of obviousness may be rebutted \\u201cwhere the results of optimizing a variable, which was known to be result effective, [are] unexpectedly good\\u201d).  The Appellant has not made such a showing on this record.   As for the concentration of butane in Hensley\\u2019s feed, we find the feeds employed by the Appellant and Hensley are both used for manufacturing MTBE.  Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the feeds would have similar butane concentrations.  In this regard, we note the Appellant does not disclose that the butane concentration is critical and indicates that as little as about 1% vol butane may be contained in the feedstock.  Spec., \\xb6 [0016]. Based on the foregoing, the weight of the evidence supports a conclusion of obviousness under \\xa7 103(a).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007962 Application 11/927,834   8  Claim 28 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Tsunoda, Hensley, paragraphs [0003] and [0004] of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification, and Miracca.  Claim 28 is reproduced below from the Claims Appendix of the Appeal Brief. 28. The process of claim 1, wherein the first product further comprises isobutane, hydrogen, and C1 to C3 hydrocarbons, and the process further comprises:  contacting at least a portion of the first product with a solvent to provide a solvent mixture;  separating the solvent mixture to produce a purified isobutane/isobutylene mixture, wherein the purified isobutane/isobutylene mixture contains less hydrogen and C1 to C3 hydrocarbons than the first product, and wherein at least a portion of the purified isobutane/isobutylene mixture is cracked to provide the second product.  The Examiner found Miracca discloses an integrated process for producing isobutene and alkyl tert-butyl ethers similar to Hensley.  The Examiner continues: Miracca also discloses separation of first product including hydrogen, light hydrocarbons, and C4 hydrocarbons (See column 1, lines 59-61).  Miracca further discloses separation and purification of C4 hydrocarbons using a suitable solvent followed by C4 stripping and solvent regeneration (See column 1, lines 65-68).  Miracca also discloses separation and purification of isobutene/isobutane fraction (See column 2, lines 18-26).  In view of Miracca disclosing separation and purification of isobutene/isobutane fraction, and Tsunoda disclosing that when olefin content of hydrocarbon feedstock is less than 20%, the yields of ethylene and propylene are unsatisfactory (See column 6, lines 32-34), it would have been obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art at the time of invention to combine Leyshon/Hensley/Tsunoda invention with Miracca invention and use the isobutene/isobutane fraction from \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007962 Application 11/927,834   9  Miracca in the cracking step of Tsunoda for an increased ethylene/propylene production. Ans. 11.  The Appellant does not direct us to any evidence to the contrary.  We find the benefits achieved in the modified Leyshon process with the addition of Miracca (i.e., increased ethylene/propylene production) would have been equally desirable in the modified Tsunoda process.  For this reason, we conclude the process of claim 28 is rendered obvious by the combination of Tsunoda, Hensley, paragraphs [0003] and [0004] of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification, and Miracca. D. DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 1-18, 26, 27, and 29-31 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Leyshon in view of Hensley and Tsunoda is reversed. The Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 28 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Leyshon in view of Hensley, Tsunoda, and Miracca is reversed.    Claims 1-18, 26, 27, and 29-31 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over the combination of Tsunoda, Hensley, and paragraphs [0003] and [0004] of the Appellant\\u2019s Specification.

This decision contains new grounds of rejection under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.50(b) which provides that \\u201c[a] new ground of rejection . . . shall not be considered final for judicial review.\\u201d \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-007962 Application 11/927,834   10  37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.50(b) also provides that the Appellant, WITHIN TWO MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THE DECISION, must exercise one of the following two options with respect to the new grounds of rejection to avoid termination of the appeal as to the rejected claims:  (1) Reopen prosecution.  Submit an appropriate amendment of the claims so rejected or new evidence relating to the claims so rejected, or both, and have the matter reconsidered by the examiner, in which event the proceeding will be remanded to the examiner. . . . (2) Request rehearing.  Request that the proceeding be reheard under  \\xa7 41.52 by the Board upon the same record. . . .

We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b). We REVERSE.  CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER The claims are directed to an adjustable width bariatric transport support surface.  Claims 1, 15, and 18 are independent.  Claim 1 is reproduced below: 1. An adjustable width support surface, for use with adjustable width bed frames or bed frames of fixed, but various widths, comprising:  a plurality of inflatable air cells defining the support surface in its entirety and each including an inflatable central section, the plurality of inflatable air cells each further having at least one independently controllable compartment connected to and extending from a lateral end of the inflatable central section; and   a controller communicating with the at least one independently controllable compartment, the controller selectively varying a width of the entire support surface by inflating or deflating the at least one independently controllable compartment.  PRIOR ART Ellis US 6,021,533 Feb. 8, 2000  GROUNDS OF REJECTION 1. Claims 1, 2, 4-6, 15, and 16 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C \\xa7102(b) as anticipated by Ellis. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013690 Application 11/164,314  3 2. Claims 3, 7-14, and 17-22 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as anticipated by or, in the alternative, under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Ellis.  OPINION The Examiner finds that Ellis discloses each and every limitation of independent claim 1.  In particular, the Examiner identifies Ellis\\u2019 surface cushions 40, 44 and 46 as the plurality of inflatable air cells.  See Ans. 3.  However, the Examiner  notes Figure 1 of Ellis and the disclosure of Ellis [which states that] \\u2018[s]upport surface bladders 38 are located on top of bladders 32, 34, and 36 within interior region 18.  Support surface cushions 38 include a head cushion 40, a chest cushion 42, a seat cushion 44, and a foot cushion 46.  Support cushions 40, 44, and 46 include inner bladder sections 48 and outer bladder sections 50 and 51 which are separately controllable from an air supply source as discussed below.\\u2019 Ans. 4 (quoting Ellis, col. 5, ll. 24-30).    Appellants argue that air cells 40, 44 and 46 \\u201cdo not define the support surface \\u2018in its entirety\\u2019 as the surface also includes chest support surface cushion 42.\\u201d  App. Br. 13-14; see also Reply Br. 1-2.  In response to Appellants\\u2019 argument, the Examiner determines that \\u201c[t]here is nothing in Appellant[]s[\\u2019] claim that ties the \\u2018support surface in its entirety\\u2019 to span the entire length of the mattress.\\u201d  Ans. 8.  The Examiner provides the following two examples in support of this determination: 1. If the patient was on their hands and knees.  Ans. 9. 2. If the patient was a baby placed at the foot of the bed.  See id.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013690 Application 11/164,314  4  Neither of these examples is persuasive because the elements that define the entirety of the support surface are not dependent on the user or the use to which the support surface is put.  With respect to the Examiner\\u2019s first example, the fact that one or more air cells (i.e., cushion 42) might not be used when the user is in a particular configuration (on their hands and knees) does not preclude that air cell from still being a part of Ellis\\u2019 support surface.  The Examiner\\u2019s second example is not persuasive as the rejection explicitly includes cushion 40 as part of the support surface.  Further, by quoting Ellis\\u2019 description of support surface cushions 38 (which include cushions 40, 42, 44, and 46) in the statement of the rejection the Examiner essentially concedes that cushion 42 is part of the support surface. Appellants further argue, \\u201cit would be impossible with the Ellis structure to adjust a width of its support surface by outer bladder sections 50, 51 as at least the chest cushion 42 would maintain its width.\\u201d  App. Br. 14; Reply Br. 3.  We agree.  As discussed supra, given that the rejection includes Eliot\\u2019s cushion 42 as part of the support surface it is unreasonable in the context of a rejection based on anticipation to exclude cushion 42 as part of the support surface; and, given that cushion 42 does not include outer bladder sections 50 and 51, the width of the entire support surface cannot be varied \\u201cby inflating or deflating the at least one independently controllable compartment,\\u201d as required by claim 1.   For these reasons, we cannot sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1 and claims 2-14 as anticipated by Ellis.  Claims 15 and 18 similarly require \\u201cvarying the width of the support surface in its entirety by deflating or inflating the independently controllable compartments\\u201d and \\u201cvarying a width of the entire support surface inflating or deflating the independently \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013690 Application 11/164,314  5 controllable compartments.\\u201d  App. Br. 22.  Accordingly, we cannot sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 15 and 18 and claims 16, 17 and 19-22, which depend therefrom as anticipated by Ellis. The Examiner alternatively rejects claims 3, 7-14, and 17-22 as unpatentable over Ellis.  The Examiner finds that \\u201c[u]sing a separate line for each section is considered a disclosure that each separate section is independently controllable.\\u201d  Ans. 5.  The Examiner concludes, \\u201cit would be obvious to independently control any section of the entire bed as this is a well known way in the art to be able to put an inflatable bed in various arrangements.\\u201d  Id.    The Examiner\\u2019s reasoning does not cure the deficiencies in Ellis discussed supra.  Accordingly, we cannot sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 3, 7-14, and 17-22 as unpatentable over Ellis.   DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s rejections of claims 1-22 are REVERSED.

BROWN, MICHAEL L. HOELTER, and  CARL M. DeFRANCO JR., Administrative Patent Judges.  DeFRANCO, Administrative Patent Judge.   DECISION ON APPEAL \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008899 Application 11/680,688  2  STATEMENT OF THE CASE  Appellant appeals under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from the Examiner\\u2019s final rejection of claims 1, 3-14, 16, 17, 19-30, and 32-49.  App. Br. 2.  Claims 2, 15, 18, and 31 have been canceled.  Id.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We affirm. THE CLAIMED INVENTION The claimed invention relates to \\u201ca hinge method and apparatus and an electronic device having the same.\\u201d  Spec., para. [0002].  Claims 1, 14, 16, 30, 33, and 37 are independent.  Claim 1 is illustrative of the claims on appeal and reads: 1. A hinge apparatus comprising: a first hinge unit having a first hinge shaft rotatably connected to a first electronic unit; a second hinge unit having a second hinge shaft connected to a second electronic unit and rotatable in a predetermined angle with respect to the first hinge shaft, the second hinge shaft having a hollow; and  a signal connecting unit inserted into the hollow of the second hinge unit to electrically connect the first and the second electronic units with each other;  wherein the first hinge shaft has a coupling hole through which the second hinge shaft is rotatably coupled, and  wherein the second hinge shaft passes completely through the coupling hole. App. Br. 23, Claims App\\u2019x (emphasis added). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008899 Application 11/680,688  3  THE REJECTIONS ON APPEAL  Appellant seeks review of the following rejections by the Examiner:  1) the final rejection of claim 33 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112, second paragraph, as being indefinite;  2) the final rejection of claims 1, 10-14, 16, 17, 24-30, 33-35, 37, and 40-49 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over APA (Appellant\\u2019s Admitted Prior Art) and Ahn1 (US 2004/0231105 A1, pub. Nov. 25, 2004); and  3) the final rejection of claims 3-9, 19-23, 32, 36, 38, and 39 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a), as being unpatentable over APA, Ahn, and Yamada (US 7,155,781 B2, iss. Jan. 2, 2007). ANALYSIS \\xa7 112 Indefiniteness \\u2013 Claim 33  Claim 33 recites, in relevant part, \\u201ca second hinge unit rotatably coupled to the first hinge unit in a second direction with respect to the first electronic unit, and having a hollow to pass completely through the hinge shaft.\\u201d  App. Br. 28, Cls. App\\u2019x.  The Examiner rejected claim 33 for indefiniteness under \\xa7 112, second paragraph, because it is unclear whether the \\u201chollow\\u201d functions as part of the hinge shaft or as part of the second hinge unit.  Ans. 3-4.  We agree with the Examiner that claim 33 lacks clarity.  As presently recited, the hollow could reasonably be interpreted as the passageway by which the second hinge unit passes through the hinge shaft.  That interpretation, however, does not accurately depict the function of the hollow.  Rather, as described in the Specification, the hollow serves as \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01 The Examiner uses the patent number \\u201c\\u2018105\\u201d in referencing Ahn, but we will use the named inventor, \\u201cAhn,\\u201d which Appellant likewise uses. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008899 Application 11/680,688  4  a passageway within the second hinge unit, not as a passageway for the second hinge unit (i.e., a hollow that allows the second hinge unit to pass through the hinge shaft).  Thus, the hollow is actually part of the structure of the second hinge unit, not the hinge shaft.  Claim 33 as presently worded does not make that clear.  We are not persuaded by Appellant\\u2019s arguments to the contrary.  See App. Br. 6-7; Reply Br. 4.  As such, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 33 as being indefinite under \\xa7 112, second paragraph. \\xa7 103 Obviousness - Claims 1, 10-14, 16, 17, 24-30, 33-35, 37 and 40-49  Appellant makes essentially the same arguments for independent claims 1, 14, 30, and 33.  App. Br. 7-19; Reply Br. 5-8.  We select claim 1 as representative of the group.  See 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37(c)(1)(vii)(2011).  In addition to relying on the same arguments as made for claim 1, Appellant raises a separate argument for independent claims 16 and 37.  App. Br. 17, 19-20; Reply Br. 8.  We address that additional argument separately.  Because Appellant does not separately argue dependent claims 10-13, 17, 24-29, 34, 35, and 40-49 (App. Br. 20), they will stand or fall with their respective parent claims.    The Examiner found that APA teaches all the limitations of claims 1, 14, 16, 30, 33, and 37, except \\u201cthe second hinge shaft having a hollow\\u201d and \\u201cthe signal connecting unit inserted into the hollow of the second hinge unit.\\u201d  Ans. 5-6.  For those limitations, the Examiner relied upon Ahn, finding that it teaches \\u201cthe use of hinge shafts (Fig. 2: 136, 132) each having a hollow interior through which a signal connecting unit is inserted.\\u201d  Id. at 5.  The Examiner concluded that a skilled artisan would have found it \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008899 Application 11/680,688  5  obvious to make the second hinge shaft of APA in the form of a hollow shaft, as taught by Ahn, in order to conceal the wiring of the signal connecting unit from being exposed to the outside of the electronic device.  Id.   Appellant proffers myriad arguments against the Examiner\\u2019s combination of APA and Ahn.  App. Br. 7-20; Reply Br. 5-8.  First, Appellant argues that Figure 2 of Ahn \\u201cteaches away\\u201d from its proposed combination with APA.  App. Br. passim; Reply Br. 5-6.  According to Appellant, Figure 2 of Ahn simply shows a \\u201cconventional\\u201d and \\u201cdisadvantageous\\u201d embodiment, whereas Figures 5-8 of Ahn depict the preferred embodiment.  Id.  Based on that distinction, Appellant argues that a skilled artisan would not \\u201crevert back\\u201d from the improved structure of Ahn\\u2019s figures 5-8 to utilize the less desirable structure of Ahn\\u2019s figure 2.  App. Br. 10, 13; Reply Br. 6.  In Appellant\\u2019s view, a skilled artisan would focus solely on the teachings of Ahn\\u2019s Figures 5-8 to the exclusion of the teaching of Ahn\\u2019s Figure 2.  Appellant\\u2019s argument is not persuasive.  Just because Ahn\\u2019s through-hole wiring disclosure (Figure 2, paras. [0008]-[0013]) may have disadvantageous qualities does not make \\u201creverting back\\u201d to such an alternative non-obvious.  See In re Gurley, 27 F.3d 551, 553 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (\\u201cA known or obvious composition does not become patentable simply because it has been described as somewhat inferior to some other product for the same use.\\u201d).  More specifically, Ahn\\u2019s disclosure of more than one alternative (i.e., through-hole wiring and wrap-around wiring) does not constitute a teaching away because Ahn does not \\u201ccriticize, discredit or otherwise discourage\\u201d investigation into any of the disclosed alternatives.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008899 Application 11/680,688  6  See In re Fulton, 391 F.3d 1195, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  To the contrary, Ahn simply recognizes that through-hole wiring may not be suitable where \\u201cthick wiring\\u201d is required, and hence, offers an alternative of wrap-around wiring for such \\u201cthick wiring.\\u201d  See Ahn, paras. [0012]-[0013].  Such disclosure alone would not lead a skilled artisan \\u201cin a direction divergent from the path that was taken by [Appellant].\\u201d  See In re Haruna, 249 F.3d 1327, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Rather, viewing Ahn in its entirety, a skilled artisan would recognize that Ahn\\u2019s two types of wiring structures are known substitutes, in other words, \\u201cthe known structure of a hinge shaft having a hollow and a connector extending through that hollow can be substituted for the known structure of a hinge shaft which has a connector wound around said hinge shaft, and vice versa.\\u201d  See Ans. 11.  As such, the Examiner correctly reasoned that a skilled artisan would have deemed it obvious to substitute Ahn\\u2019s through-hole wiring structure for APA\\u2019s wrap-around wiring structure.  See KSR Int\\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 418 (2007) (recognizing that claimed subject matter is likely obvious where it involves nothing more than the simple substitution of one known element for another).    Appellant next argues that Ahn does not teach or suggest that the second hinge shaft can be inserted through the first hinge shaft.  App. Br. 11.  The Examiner, however, did not rely on Ahn for teaching that limitation but on APA.  Specifically, the Examiner found that APA\\u2019s \\u201cfirst hinge shaft has a coupling hole through which the second hinge shaft is rotatably coupled, wherein the second hinge shaft passes completely through the coupling \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008899 Application 11/680,688  7  hole.\\u201d  Ans. 5, para. 11.  Given that the Examiner relied upon APA, and not Ahn, Appellant\\u2019s argument is unavailing.  Appellant also contends that there is no motivation to combine the teachings of Ahn with APA and that the Examiner resorts to impermissible hindsight.  App. Br. 10-11, 13, 15; Reply Br. 5, 9.  We disagree.  When a patent claims a structure already known in the prior art that is altered by the mere substitution of one element for another known in the field, the combination must do more than yield a predictable result.   See KSR, 550 U.S. at 416.  Here, the Examiner correctly determined that wrapping a cable around the outside of a hinge shaft and passing a cable through an opening in a hinge shaft are both well known in the prior art, as taught by Ahn, and that simple substitution of one type of cable connecting device for another does nothing more than yield a predictable result.  Ans. 11.  Appellant has not apprised us of reversible error in the Examiner\\u2019s finding or rationale on this point.  Finally, independent claims 16 and 37 recite the additional limitation of \\u201ca rotation controlling unit including a plurality of rotation elements disposed on opposing sides of the first hinge shaft.\\u201d  Appellant argues that APA does not disclose \\u201crotation elements.\\u201d  App. Br. 17, 19-20; Reply Br. 8.  The Examiner determined, however, that \\u201c[t]he term \\u2018rotation elements\\u2019 is sufficiently broad to encompass any and all elements associated with or attached to the rotation members (20, 11).\\u201d  Ans. 12.  Based on that interpretation, the Examiner found that APA shows \\u201cseveral members\\u201d surrounding hinge shaft 20 and adjacent to hinge shaft 11 which, \\u201cgiven their location on a hinge device, they are easily classified as \\u2018rotation elements\\u2019 whether or not they rotate with or in relation to any given hinge \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008899 Application 11/680,688  8  shaft.\\u201d  Id.  The Examiner further found that \\u201cthe rotation elements attached to [hinge shaft] members 20 and 11 will alter the force and frictional properties of the rotation members and therefore restrict a rotation range of the second hinge unit.\\u201d  Id.  Appellant responds that the Examiner does not show where APA teaches or suggests the claimed rotation elements and \\u201cmerely speculates about what is not present in APA.\\u201d  Reply Br. 8.  We disagree.  As the Examiner clearly explained, APA shows various elements associated with and attached to hinge shafts 11, 20, which given Appellant\\u2019s broad use of the term, can be interpreted as \\u201crotation elements.\\u201d  Appellant does not provide sufficiently persuasive evidence or reasoning to overcome the Examiner\\u2019s findings and rationale as to claims 16 and 37.  For the foregoing reasons, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 1, 14, 16, 30, 33, and 37, and dependent claims 10-13, 17, 24-29, 34, 35, and 40-49 which fall therewith, as being obvious over APA and Ahn. \\xa7 103 Obviousness - Claims 3-9, 19-23, 32, 36 and 38-39  Appellant makes essentially the same arguments for dependent claims 3, 9, and 23.  App. Br. 20-21.  We address them as a group.  As for dependent claims 4-8, 19-22, 32, 36, 38, and 39, Appellant relies on their dependency from independent claims 1, 16, 30, 33, and 37 and the arguments made with respect to them as discussed above.  App. Br. 22.  As such, they will stand or fall with their respective parent claims.  The Examiner found that APA and Ahn teach all the limitations of claims 3, 9, and 23 except (1) a rotation controlling unit to restrict rotation of the second hinge unit relative to the first hinge unit, and (2) a hinge casing to surround exposed parts of the first hinge unit, the second hinge unit and the \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008899 Application 11/680,688  9  signal connecting unit.  Ans. 7-8.  The Examiner relied upon Yamada as teaching those limitations, referencing element 7 for the rotation controlling unit and Figures 1 and 6 for the hinge casing.  Id. (paras. 23 and 29, respectively). The Examiner concluded that a skilled artisan would have deemed it obvious to apply the specific rotation controlling unit and hinge casing of Yamada to the modified APA device in order to better control the rotation of the hinge and to surround exposed parts.  Id. at 7 (para. 22).  Appellant argues that Yamada does not teach the specific rotation controlling unit as claimed because Yamada\\u2019s \\u201cshaft 5 does not \\u2018pass completely through the coupling hole\\u2019 of the body portion 2.\\u201d  App. Br. 21.  Appellant\\u2019s argument is not persuasive.  The Examiner did not rely on Yamada to teach the limitation of a shaft that passes completely through a coupling hole.  Rather, the Examiner found that limitation in APA (Ans. 5) and relied upon Yamada as teaching the specific rotation controlling unit (Ans. 7).  One cannot show nonobviousness by attacking references individually where the rejection is based on a combination of references.  See In re Keller, 642 F.2d 413, 426 (CCPA 1981); In re Merck & Co., 800 F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986).  As such, we sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 3, 9, and 23.  We also sustain the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 4-8, 19-22, 32, 36, 38, and 39, which fall with their respective parent claims.  DECISION  We affirm the Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting claims 1, 3-14, 16, 17, 19-30, and 32-49. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-008899 Application 11/680,688  10  No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a).

JENKS, Administrative Patent Judge  DECISION ON APPEAL This is an appeal1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 involving claims directed to a method, system, and computer program controlling a print engine for printing N-UP print jobs.  The Patent Examiner has rejected the claims as obvious.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We affirm.                                              1 Appellants identify InfoPrint Solutions Company LLC as the Real Party in Interest (App. Br. 3). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Specification discloses \\u201cmethods and systems for N-UP print imaging dynamically controlled by a printer so as to permit dynamic changes in printing parameters during printing of a print job . . . independent of the host systems that supply print jobs.\\u201d  (Spec. 1, ll. 5-9.) Claims 1-26, 28, and 30-35 are on appeal, and can be found in the Claims Appendix (App. Br. 15-26).  Claim 1 is illustrative of the claims on appeal, and reads as follows: 1.  A method operable within a printer controller associated with at least one print engine for printing N-UP print jobs, the method comprising: receiving, by operation of the printer controller, a print job; rasterizing, by operation of the printer controller, the received print job to generate a rasterized print job wherein the rasterized print job comprises one or more logical pages; initiating, by operation of the printer controller, printing of the rasterized print job as an N-UP print job wherein the initiated printing includes positioning the one or more logical pages on physical sheet images according to an initial set of printing parameters associated with the rasterized print job wherein the set of printing parameters includes information relating to positioning of the one or more logical pages on physical sheet images; changing, by operation of the printer controller, at least one of the printing parameters associated with the rasterized print job during printing of the rasterized print job wherein the changed printing parameters include changes to the information relating to positioning; and continuing, by operation of the printer controller, to print the rasterized print job wherein the continued printing includes positioning unprinted logical pages on physical sheet images according to the changed set of printing parameters. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  3  The Examiner has rejected the claims as follows:2  I. claims 1, 2, 8-10, 15, 17, 18, 24-26, and 28 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) over Zuber3 in view of Hisatake;4 II. claims 3, 14, and 19 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) over Zuber and Hisatake in view of Grace;5 III. claims 4-7, 11-13, 16, 22, and 23 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7103(a) over Zuber and Hisatake in view of Mori;6 IV. claims 30-35 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) over Zuber in view of Pavlovic7 and Brindle.8   I-III. The Issue: Obviousness over Zuber and Hisatake The Examiner takes the position that Zuber teaches all aspects of claim 1 but \\u201cfails to specifically teach wherein the set of printing parameters includes information relating to positioning of the one or more logical pages on physical sheet images; and wherein the changed printing parameters include changes to the information relating to the positioning.\\u201d  (Ans. 7.)  The Examiner finds that \\u201cHisatake \\u2018040 discloses wherein the set of printing parameters includes information relating to positioning of the one or more logical pages on physical sheet images. . . . [T]he Hisatake reference is able to change the N-up amount of a job during printing, the paper size and the number of copies.\\u201d  (Id.)  The Examiner concludes that:                                            2 The rejection of claims 17-25 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 101 is withdrawn (Ans. 4). 3 Peter A.

(Id. at 8.) Has the Examiner provided sufficient factual findings and sound reasons to support a determination that persons of ordinary skill in the art would have been prompted to combine the teaching of the prior art to arrive at the claimed invention?  Findings of Fact  FF 1.  Zuber disclosed a graphical user interface (GUI) printer controller that allows an operator to make adjustments in the output while the print job is in progress (Zuber col. 4, ll. 6-28; Ans. 5, 55).

In this case, the operator presses the parts in the job setting and display section U2 for changing the magnification, paper size, etc., according to the change contents. To simplify control, the setup contents of the job being processed may be inhibited from being altered. (Hisatake, col. 13, ll. 1-14 (emphasis added); Ans. 8.)  FF 4. The Specification provides that a \\u201clogical page\\u201d is a ripped print job comprising one or more rasterized images (Spec. 2: ll. 11-12).  FF 5. According to the Specification \\u201c[m]ultiple logical pages may be applied to opposing sides of the printable medium (often referred to as duplex or two-sided printing) and/or multiple logical pages may be applied to the same side of the printable medium (often referred to as N-UP printing).\\u201d  (Spec. 2: ll. 26-28.)   Principle of Law  \\u201cIn determining whether obviousness is established by combining the teachings of the prior art, the test is what the combined teachings of the references would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art.\\u201d  In re GPAC Inc., 57 F.3d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (internal quotations omitted).  Analysis The first three obviousness rejections (I.-III.), are premised, in whole or in part, on the teachings of Zuber and Hisatake, so we will discuss them together. Appellants contend that: The method [of claim 1] also includes changing at least one of \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  8 the position related printing parameters during printing of the rasterized print job and thus printing the rasterized print job with the changed parameter.  Again, all of this takes place at the printer controller and nothing in the prior art or the cited references relates to changing the positions of already rasterized logical pages of N-UP print jobs at the printer controller. (App. Br. 9.)  Appellants contend that \\u201cZuber is not even related to N-UP print processing.  Rather, Zuber is related to the parallel processing of a print job based on the number of copies of that print job to be printed.\\u201d  (Id. at 10.) We are not persuaded.  \\u201c[D]uring examination proceedings, claims are given their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification.\\u201d  In re Hyatt, 211 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The Examiner finds that \\u201c[t]he claim language does not limit itself to only a plurality of logical pages, and this is why this reference is still relevant to the rejection.  In addition, it is well known that the \\u201cN\\u201d in N-UP can be 1 or more pages per sheet.\\u201d  (Ans. 54-55.)  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s position that \\u201cone or more logical pages\\u201d as recited in claim 1 can include a single page, specifically, when N equals one.   According to the Examiner, Zuber disclosed marking engines that generates a RIPed image for distribution to the printers (Zuber, col. 3, 37-39; Ans. 54).  Changes to the rasterized image may be made during the printing process and \\u201cthe system may apply the changes to the unprinted pages of the print job\\u201d (Ans. 55; FF 1).  As acknowledged by the Examiner, the GUI display provides individual adjustments for six parameters (FF 1), but \\u201cdoes not disclose the feature of changing the positioning of logical pages, or rasterized images, during the printing phase of the invention\\u201d (Ans. 55).  The Examiner finds, and Appellants do not dispute, that changes to the print job \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  9 disclosed in Zuber are changes directed toward post-rasterization activities (Ans. 55; see also App. Br. 11). According to Appellants \\u201cHisatake is explicitly directed to processing pre-rasterized print jobs, not the post rasterized logical pages of the Appellant's claims.\\u201d  (Id. at 11.)   We are not persuaded by Appellants contention that Hisatake is limited to manipulating pre-rasterized print jobs.  The Examiner finds that: [T]he Hisatake reference manipulates the image data after printing [commences] in two manners. The first manner alters the image data in a \\u201cStop and Alteration\\u201d manner.  This is when the user stops the job and then alters the contents.  Also, the system discloses the \\u201cContinuation and Alteration\\u201d manner that alters image data during processing of the print data.  Both examples show that the alteration of the image data occur after printing and the later example shows an instance of changing the image data during the output processing of the image data. (Ans. 57.)  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s position that Hisatake \\u201cdeals with bitmap data.  It is well known in the art to have the terms raster graphics and bitmap interchangeable.\\u201d  (Ans. 56.)  Each page description language has proper code and \\u201c[t]he code data development section 21 converts the print data described in code into bitmap image data\\u201d (Hisatake col. 8, l. 67 to col. 9, l. 2; Ans. 57; see also FF 4).  Furthermore, \\u201c[t]he image data processing section 17 may perform edge smoothing processing for the bit map image data as required\\u201d (Hisatake col. 9, ll. 9-11; Ans. 57).  We find that the Examiner has provided adequate evidence and sound reasoning to conclude that Hisatake teaches rasterized image processing at the printer controller because the manipulations occur during the printing output (Ans. 57; FFs 2-5.) \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  10  Appellants specifically direct our attention to two sections of Hisatake (col. 7, ll. 32-42 and column 12, lines 11-20) as allegedly showing that formatting the print job occurs outside the printer controller prior to printing that print job and that this image server is not a printer controller (App. Br. 10). We have carefully reviewed the cited sections of Hisatake, however, we find no evidence in these paragraphs to indicate that the job console does not control the printer function of the composite machine as indicate by the Examiner (Ans. 55-56).  As acknowledged by the Examiner, the composite machine of Hisatake has many functions such as \\u201ca copy function job, a print function job, a scan and filing function job, FAX transmission/reception function job, etc., for example, as input/output processing functions\\u201d  (Hisatake col. 5, ll. 54-57; Ans. 56).  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s position that \\u201c[s]ince the composite machine prints data with a printing device and is controlled by a control section, or controller, that [sic] Examiner considers the image I/O server as a copier, or printing device with a printer controller.\\u201d  (Ans. 56.)  Accordingly, we are not persuaded by Appellants contention that Hisatake fails to provide a printer controller for formatting print jobs. Appellants err in attacking the references individually, as the rejection is based on a combination of references.  See In re Merck & Co., Inc., 800 F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986).  The references cannot be read in isolation, but for what they teach in combination with the prior art as a whole.  See id.  The Examiner found that Zuber disclosed a printer controller that is able to print N-Up print jobs where N equals one, in other words the reference prints single logical pages and allows for changes in the print \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  11 quality during the printing process (FF 1).  As explained by the Examiner Hisatake also manipulates image data after printing commences (Ans. 57).  \\u201cThus, with the N-UP feature of the job able to be manipulated as a feature of job modification during processing and processing bitmapped data al within the Hisatake reference the Examiner believes that the Hisatake reference performs the feature of the claims and cures any deficiencies of Zuber.\\u201d  (Id. at. 58.)  We agree with the Examiner conclusion that Hisatake provides the feature of positioning unprinted logical pages (FF 2) and that the combination with Zuber provides all the limitations of claim 1.  In summary, the Examiner has provided an adequate basis for concluding that a method meeting all the limitations of claim 1 would have been obvious based on Zuber and Hisatake.  Appellants acknowledged that claim 1 is representative of the N-Up formatting (App. Br. 9), claims 2-26 and 28 have not been argued separately and are affirmed for the same reasons as claim 1.  37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37 (c)(1)(vii).   IV. The Issue: Obviousness over Zuber, Pavlovic, and Brindle With respect to claim 30, the Examiner takes the position that Zuber teaches all aspects of the claim, but \\u201cfails to specifically teach formatting the first and second rasterized print jobs to print as a single N-UP print job; and printing the N-UP print job.\\u201d  (Ans. 46.)  According to the Examiner, \\u201cPavlovic discloses combining files of different PDL types into a single document and formatting the files as a single output document.\\u201d  (Id.)  While \\u201cBrindle specifically states combining different heterogeneous image processing jobs into a single job for output.\\u201d  (Id. at 47.) \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  12 With respect to claim 34, the Examiner takes the position that Zuber teaches all aspects of the claim, but \\u201cfails to specifically teach to format the logical pages of the first and second rasterized print jobs into an N-UP rasterized print job, wherein the N-UP sheet formatter further communicates formatted N-UP sheets to the print engine as rasterized images.\\u201d  (Ans. 51-53.)  According to the Examiner \\u201cin the system of Pavlovic, the first file and the second file received can be reformatted and combined to generate a single n-up job to be output.  Once these files are combined and decomposed, the system can send these jobs as one single output document for printing to the printing engine\\u201d (Id. at 52.)  The Examiner finds that \\u201cBrindle specifically states combining different heterogeneous image processing jobs into a single job for output\\u201d (id. at 53.)  The Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill at the time the invention was made to have the features of to format the logical pages of the first and second rasterized print jobs into an N-UP rasterized print job, incorporated in the device of Zuber \\u2018187, as modified by the features of Pavlovic \\u2018379, in order to combine heterogeneous jobs into a single document for output. (Id.). Has the Examiner provided sufficient factual findings and sound reasons to support a determination that persons of ordinary skill in the art would have been prompted to combine the teaching of the prior art to arrive at the claimed invention?  Findings of Fact  FF 6. Pavlovic disclosed: The Xerox \\u201cDocuTech\\u201d\\xae network printing system includes \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  13 provision for combining multiple files together as a unique print job, even if the different files are of different PDL file types or TIFF image files.  Separate files can be submitted to the network server, and then submitted by the network server to printer hardware as a single output document. (Pavlovic, col. 2, ll. 46-52; Ans. 46.)  FF 7. Pavlovic provides: A buffer retains discrete page image output by either of the first decomposer and second decomposer.  A buffer manager directs . . . records the location of each page image in the buffer, A marker requests a set of page images desired to be printed to be read from the buffer to printing hardware. (Pavlovic, col. 2, l. 64 to col 3, l. 4.)  FF 8.  Pavlovic provides that: It may also be desirable to provide separate decomposers of the same type, such as PostScript, but which output bitmaps at different resolutions, such as 300 spots per inch and 600 spots per inch.    After a file from spool 106 is decomposed or interpreted by one of the appropriate decomposers in decomposition  facility 110, the output is digital data which can be used to operate, for example, a xerographic or ink-jet marking 55 engine in printer hardware 114. (Pavlovic, col. 4, ll. 47-55.)  FF 9. Brindle disclosed: Whether the translated data is in the form of a PDL, such as Interpress, or substantially in binary form ready for direct application to an IOT, the intended effect of the accumulation of translated data in the memory is to create a single data set without any apparent \\u201cseams: between one section and the next. That is, the translated data should be in a form for sending to the printer 50 or IOT 98 in such a way that the disparate origins and original data formats of all of the sections are invisible. One possible technique for creating such a continuous or \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  14 \\u201cseamless\\u201d output is to load the translated data from the first section to an origin point within the memory, and then, in the next cycle, to load the translated data from the second job starting at a point immediately following the end of the translated data for the first section. . . . At any rate, it is desirable that the final translated data should be in a form sendable to output hardware as one piece. (Brindle, col. 8, ll. 26-48; Ans. 47.)  Analysis Appellants contented that Pavlovic \\u201cmerley suggests that a single print job may be generated from multiple files each encoded in a different page description language . . . But, there is only one print job that is rasterized in the teachings of Pavlovic as compared to the multiple print jobs rasterized and then formatted into a single N-UP print job as the Appellant claims.\\u201d  (App. Br. 11.) We are not persuaded by Appellants contention that Pavlovic does not disclose formatting a single print job from multiple rasterized images.  The decomposers of Pavlovic output the image data into bitmaps (FF 8).  The discrete image data is stored separately in a buffer and is accessed using a marker, and this stored bitmap information can be read directly from the buffer to the printing hardware (FF 7).  Pavlovic provides that  [a] practical advantage of the present system is that the system enables simultaneous decomposition of files of different PDLs or formats, and enables these different-format files to be combined in a single job.  That is, the different decomposition facilities 110a-d can be made to operate simultaneously, and further in a manner in which one particular decomposition facility need not wait for another to be completed before submitting its decomposed data to spool 116. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  15 (Pavlovic, col. 7, ll. 1-9.)  In other words, Pavlovic disclosed that the combination of the different file formats only occurs after the simultaneous decomposition of the files into bitmap data. (Id., see also FF 8.)  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that: it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill at the time the invention was made to have the features of formatting the first and second rasterized prints to print as a single N-UP print job and printing the N-UP print job, incorporated in the device of Zuber \\u2018187, in order to combine multiple files of different PDL types. (Ans. 46.)  Appellants contend that \\u201cBrindle discloses combining image data of different print jobs into a single print job.  However, Brindle\\u2019s image data is not the same as the logical pages of the Appellant\\u2019s claims because they are not rasterized.\\u201d  (App. Br. 12.)  Appellants contend that: Brindle, like Hisatake, discloses a print job that may be conjoined with one or more other print jobs to print as a single print job prior to rasterization.  But, Brindle does not disclose rasterized print jobs that may be conjoined. Brindle merely discloses preparing image data of multiple print jobs into a single print job that may be subsequently rasterized and printed. (App. Br. 12.)     We are not persuaded by Appellants contention that Brindle does not disclose joining of rasterized images.  The Examiner finds that  The first section [of Brindle] discloses translating PDL into a bit stream, or bitmap, in order for the IOT (image output terminal) to output the job. The second section of Brindle discloses the same information regarding the IOT receiving the image data in binary form, or a map of bits, that are output by the printer device. Both of these sections disclose rasterized jobs that are output by the IOT since the process of translating \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-012725 Application 11/229,343  16 PDL data into bits or a bitmap is considered rasterization. (Ans. 58.)  \\u201c[I]f the final translated data is in binary form, the bits can by [sic] sent more or less intact to a raster output scanner or ink-jet printer.\\u201d  (Brindle, col. 8, ll. 56-58; Ans. 58)  As explained by the Examiner, Brindle loads translated data, that can be in binary form ready for direct application to the IOT, into memory and then provides the loading of a second page into memory as well (Ans. 58-59; FF 9).  The two pages can be merged into a single document before they reach the output hardware (Ans. 59; FF 9).  The Examiner concludes: it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill at the time the invention was made to have the features of formatting the first and second rasterized print jobs to print as a single N-UP print job, incorporated in the device of Zuber [\\u2019]187, as modified by the features of Pavlovic [\\u2019]379, in order to combine heterogeneous jobs into a single document that is output. (Ans. 47.) In summary, the Examiner has provided an adequate basis for concluding that a method meeting all the limitations of claims 30 and 34 would have been obvious based on the combination of Zuber, Pavlovic, and Brindle.  Claims 31-33 and 35 have not been argued separately and are affirmed for the same reasons as claims 30 and 34.  37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37 (c)(1)(vii).

The\\nExaminer also \\ufb01nds that Kan\\u2019s disclosure of gathering VSP data meets the\\nclai111 36 limitation of \\u201cduring drilling of a borehole traversing the\\nsubsurface region, determining a travel time of a seismic wave generated\\nfrom a surface of the region to a location in the borehole when the drill bit is\\nat selected depths in the borehole.\\u201d Id. The Examiner further \\ufb01nds that Kan\\nuses the VSP data in \\u201cdetermining a velocity fro111 the travel time and the\\n\\nselected depths,\\u201d as required by claim 36. Id. The Examiner also finds thatAppeal 201 l-012255\\n\\nApplication 10/604,878\\n\\nKan discloses using the VSP data to replace the surface seismic data to the\\ndepths in the borehole to which the VSP data extends. Id. at 4-5. The\\nExaminer finds that this replacement constrains the replaced portion of the\\nsurface seismic data to be consistent with the velocity determined from the\\ntravel time ofthe VSP data. Ia\\u2019. at 5, 13-15.\\n\\nThe Examiner \\ufb01nds that Kan does not disclose inverting the\\nconstrained surface seismic data. Ans. 5-6. Addressing this difference\\nbetween Kan and claim 36, the Examiner finds that Stewart discloses\\ninverting surface seismic data to determine the velocity structures of\\nsubsurface structures. Ia\\u2019. at 6. The Examiner concludes that it would have\\nbeen obvious to invert Kan\\u2019s constrained surface seismic data to determine\\nthe velocity structure of the subsurface. Id.\\n\\nAppellants suggest that the claim 36 limitation \\u201cinverting the surface\\nseismic data obtained using the plurality of surface-located seismic sources\\nand receivers to determine a velocity ahead of the drill bit while constraining\\nvelocity between the surface and the drill bit to be consistent with the\\nvelocity determined from the travel time\\u201d would not have been obvious in\\nview of the cited references. App. Br. 4-1 1. Appellants argue that in\\nStewart\\u2019s disclosure \\u201c[t]here is no inversion of surface acquired seismic, in\\nparticular at greater than bit depths constrained by VSP information\\ndesc\\ufb01bed in Stewart.\\u201d Id. at l l. Appellants also argue that Kan does not\\ndisclose inversion of either its surface seismic data or its VSP data while\\nconstrained in the 111anner recited in clai111 36. Id. at 4-9. Appellants note\\nthat Kan inverts the VSP data, but Appellants argue that Kan does not\\nconstrain the VSP data when inverting it. Ia\\u2019. at 5-8. Appellants also\\n\\n4:;\\n\\ncontend tha replacing\\u2019 Velocities from transit times down to the bit depthAppeal 2011-012255\\n\\nApplication 10/604,878\\n\\ncannot be considered as a \\u2018constraint,\\u2019 arguing that \\u201c[a] constraint as that\\nterm is ordinarily understood is a limit or boundary of the inverted variable.\\u201d\\nIa\\u2019. at 8.\\n\\nThese arguments do not apprise us of error. Contrary to Appellants\\u2019\\nargument, the portions of Stewart cited by the Examiner suggest inverting\\nsurface seismic data, disclosing using \\u201csurface seismic data\\u201d in a \\u201csurface\\nseismic inversion process.\\u201d Stewart, 358, 359; Ans. 6.\\n\\nRegarding Appellants\\u2019 arguments that each reference individually\\nfails to teach or suggest inverting surface seismic data in the constrained\\n111anner recited by the claim, these arguments do not apprise us of error in\\nthe Examiner\\u2019s \\ufb01ndings that, in combination, the references disclose the\\ndisputed claim limitation. For example, even if accurate, Appellants\\u2019\\nargument that Stewart does not disclose constraining surface seismic data at\\ngreater than bit depths with VSP data does not app\\ufb01se us of error because\\nthe Examiner \\ufb01nds that Kan discloses constraining such surface seismic data\\nwith VSP data. See App. Br. 11; Ans. 4-5, 13. Similarly, Appellants\\u2019\\nargument that Kan by itself does not disclose inverting data in the claimed\\nconstrained manner, even if accurate, does not apprise us of error because\\nthe Examiner finds that Kan discloses constraining the surface seismic data\\nand Stewart discloses inverting surface seismic data, collectively disclosing\\nthe features of the disputed claim limitation. See App. Br. 4-8; Ans. 5-6.\\n\\nRegarding Appellants\\u2019 argument that replacing data does not\\nconstitute \\u201cconstraining,\\u201d this does not convince us of error in the\\nExaminer\\u2019s position that the combination of the disclosures in the references\\nwould meet the disputed claim limitations. As noted by the Examiner,\\n\\nKan\\u2019s approach of replacing portions of the surface seismic data with theAppeal 201 l-012255\\n\\nApplication 10/604,878\\n\\nVSP data would li111it the replaced portions of tl1e surface seis111ic data to the\\nVSP data values. See Ans. 5, 13-1 5. With portions of the surface seismic\\ndata li111ited to the VSP data values, inverting Kan\\u2019s surface seismic data\\nwould appear to also limit the resulting velocities to values consistent with\\nthe VSP values and, thus, consistent witl1 velocity deten11ined fro111 the\\ntravel time of the VSP data} Accordingly, even if we accept Appellants\\u2019\\nattorney argument that \\u201c[a] constraint as that term is ordinarily understood is\\na limit or boundary of the inverted variable\\u201d (App. Br. 8:), Appellants do not\\napprise us of error in the Examiner\\u2019s determination that inverting Kan\\u2019s\\nsurface seismic data subsequent to the replacement would meet the disputed\\nclai111 li111itation.\\n\\nAppellants further argue that Kan\\u2019s replacement of surface seismic\\ndata with VSP data l1as the effect of \\u201cdepth shifting\" velocities ahead of the\\ndrill bit. but does not otherwise affect the velocities ahead of the drill bit.\\nApp. Br. 8. 10. The Examiner reasonably responds that Kan shows in Figure\\n11a and discloses in column 8, line 40 to column 9, line 3 that replacing a\\nportion of the surface seismic data with the VSP data results in different\\ncalculated values of the interval transit time data, particularly below the\\nwell. Ans. 17-1 8. This portion of Kan appears to support the Examiner\\u2019s\\nposition, and Appellants provide no citation or explanation that provides\\nconvincing support for their argument. Accordingly, Appellants\\u2019 argument\\ndoes not apprise us of error.\\n\\nAppellants also argue that \\u201cKan . . . does not show making a travel\\ntime detemiination when the drill bit is disposed at a selected depth in the\\n1 Nothing in the record provides any reason to believe that inverting surface\\n\\nseismic data partially composed of the VSP data would produce a result\\ninconsistent with the VSP data or the velocity determined from it.\\n\\n6Appeal 201 l-012255\\nApplication 10/604,878\\nwellbore nor does Kan disclose such activity taking place during the drilling\\nof a wellbore.\\u201d App. Br. 4. Instead. Appellants argue. Kan discloses\\ndetermining travel time of a seismic wave fron1 the surface to a location in\\nthe borehole after removal of the drill string from the wellbore. Id. The\\nExaminer correctly notes that Appellants provide no evidentiary support for\\nthis argument. Ans. 8. The Examiner also notes that column 2. lines 52-63\\nof Kan discloses \\u201cusing vertical seismic pro\\ufb01le (VSP) or check-shot\\ninformation acquired during drilling\\u201d (emphasis added). Id. at 9. The\\nExaminer adds that Kan also discloses using MWD (measurement while\\ndrilling techniques), noting that it is known in the art that this is practiced\\nwith the drill string remaining in the wellbore. Id. (citing Kan, col. 9. ll. 48-\\n50). The cited portions of Kan support the Examiner\\u2019s position,\\noutweighing Appellants\\u2019 conclusory attorney argument.\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, Appellants\\u2019 arguments do not apprise us of\\nerror in the rejection of independent claim 36. Appellants do not provide\\nany separate arguments regarding dependent claims 37-39 and 41.\\n\\nAccordingly, we sustain the rejection of claims 36-39 and 4l.\\n\\nRejection [I\\n\\nAppellants traverse rejection ll only by referring to their arguments\\nregarding independent claim 36.

Cir. 1992).\\n\\nHere, the Examiner has furnished reasons why a person skilled in the\\nart would not recognize in the original disclosure a description of the subject\\nmatter de\\ufb01ned in the claims. ln particular, the Examiner maintains that the\\nsubject disclosure, as \\ufb01led, \\u201cdisclose[s] the voltage across the capacitor, that\\nis the voltage across the terminals of tlie capacitor, is approximately equal to\\nthe value of the voltage source\\u201d and lacks support for the claim limitation\\nproviding that \\u201cthe voltage across the capacitor of the \\ufb01rst charge pump\\narrangement is approximately equal to twice the positive value of the voltage\\nsource\\u201d (Ans. 3 and 4). The Examiner recognizes that the subject\\nSpeci\\ufb01cation describes charging the capacitor C1 to approximately double\\nthe positive voltage in a second phase; that is, the node N1 at one terminus\\nof capacitor C1 is pushed to a voltage twice the charging voltage Vbal,\\nhowever, the Examiner maintains that the voltage across the capacitor C1\\n\\nremains at Vb,\\u201c because the other terminus of the capacitor C 1 is at a voltage\\n\\nVb,\\u201d (2 X Vm\\u2014Vbat = Vmi) (Ans. 10-12; Spec. para. 0026).Appeal 2011-005935\\nApplication ll/680,296\\n\\nSpeci\\ufb01cally, in paragraph 0026 of the subject Speci\\ufb01cation, it is\\nprovided that (para. 0026):\\n\\nln a second phase, illustrated in \\ufb01gure 3b, the switches\\nS1, S4 and S; are conducting while the switches S3 and S; are\\nnot conducting. As the switch S3 is non-conducting. the\\ncapacitor C1 is connected with its negative terminal to the\\npositive charging voltage V181, and since a capacitor retains the\\nvoltage V1111 fro111 the first phase across it, this connection\\ncauses the capacitor C1 to be charged to the doubled positive\\nvoltage, i.e. the node N1 is pushed to the voltage 2*V1,a1.\\n\\nThe Examiner maintains that the above-cited passage of the\\nSpeci\\ufb01cation does not describe the voltage across the capacitor C1 (between\\nits termini) is twice V 1,1,1but rather that the voltage of the capacitor at node\\nN1 is pushed to such a doubled charging voltage.\\n\\nWhen an Examiner reasonably determines that a later claimed\\ninvention is not expressly disclosed in the application as \\ufb01led, as is the case\\nhere, the Examiner can shift the burden to the Applicants to produce\\nargument and/or evidence that such later claimed invention, including all of\\nthe limitations pertaining thereto, is described by the Speci\\ufb01cation. as \\ufb01led.\\nHere, Appellants do not meet this production burden by the citations to the\\nSpeci\\ufb01cation.

KIMLIN, CHARLES F. WARREN, and TERRY J. OWENS, Administrative Patent Judges.  KIMLIN, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL   This is an appeal from the final rejection of claims 13-20.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  Claim 13 is illustrative:  13.  An optical device comprising a first combination of birefringent prisms with parallel optic axes for dividing an optical input beam into polarized beams, a second combination of birefringent prisms with parallel optic axes for combining polarized beams into an output beam, and a polarization changer disposed between said first combination of birefringent prisms and said second combination of birefringent prisms, wherein each birefringent prism of each said combination of birefringent prisms has oblique input and output faces.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-005488 Application 10/553,132     2 The Examiner relies upon the following references as evidence of obviousness: Hesline    5,864,428   Jan. 26, 1999 Liu et al. (Liu)   US 2003/0020989 A1 Jan. 30, 2003 Zhao et al. (Zhao)   US 2003/0113055 A1 Jun. 19, 2003 Pan et al. (Pan)   US 2003/0147136 A1 Aug. 7, 2003   Appellant\\'s claimed invention is directed to an optical device comprising a first combination of birefringent prisms with parallel optic axes, a second combination of birefringent prisms with parallel optic axes, and a polarization changer disposed between the first and second combination of birefringent prisms.    The appealed claims stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as follows:  (a)  claims 13-16 and 20 over Zhao in view of Hesline,  (b)  claims 13, 15, 16, and 18 over Liu in view of Hesline, and  (c)  claims 13, 16, 17, and 19 over Pan in view of Hesline.  Appellant does not separately argue any particular claim on appeal.  Accordingly, all the appealed claims stand or fall together.  We have thoroughly reviewed each of Appellant\\'s arguments for patentability.  However, we are in complete agreement with the Examiner that the claimed subject matter would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art within the meaning of \\xa7 103 in view of the applied prior art.  Accordingly, we will sustain the Examiner\\'s rejections for the reasons set forth in the Answer, which we incorporate herein, and we add the following for emphasis only. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-005488 Application 10/553,132     3 Appellant does not set forth a substantive argument that rebuts the Examiner\\'s conclusion of obviousness with respect to the three separate rejections.  Rather, the sole argument advanced by the Appellant is that Hesline does not qualify as prior art since it is Appellant\\'s own work and does not describe the claimed invention within the meaning of \\xa7 102.  It is Appellant\\'s contention that Hesline only qualifies as prior art to support a rejection under \\xa7 102(b), but Hesline does not qualify as prior art in support of a rejection under \\xa7 103.  Appellant erroneously maintains that \"[f]or a 35  U.S.C. 103 rejection to be based on 35 U.S.C. 102, . . . , the reference must anticipate the claim\" (Reply Br. 2, last para.).  Stated otherwise, Appellant maintains that \"an applicant\\'s own work can only be prior art under 35  U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a), if it is also prior art under a statutory category of 35 U.S.C. 102\" (Prin. Br. 5, last para.).    The Examiner has properly concluded that Appellant errs in arguing that an applicant\\'s own patented work is only a statutory bar if a rejection is based on 35 U.S.C. \\xa7102(b) and not on 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103.  It is well settled that prior art available under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102 is also available as prior art under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103 (see MPEP 2141.01, and Ex parte Andresen, 212 USPQ 100, 102 (BPAI 1981).  Significantly, Appellant has cited no case law which supports his position.  Accordingly, since there is no dispute that the Hesline patent qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b), it follows that Hesline is also available as prior art in the \\xa7 103 rejections made by the Examiner.  Again, Appellant has made no argument for the nonobviousness of the claimed subject matter.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-005488 Application 10/553,132     4  In conclusion, based on the foregoing and the reasons well stated by the Examiner, the Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting the appealed claims is affirmed.   The decision of the Examiner is affirmed.   No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iv).

ADAMS, and  ULRIKE W. JENKS, Administrative Patent Judges.  JENKS, Administrative Patent Judge  DECISION ON APPEAL This is an appeal1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 involving claims directed to an apparatus for the capture and amplification of DNA samples.  The Patent Examiner has rejected the claims as lacking written descriptive support and obviousness.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We affirm.                                             1 Appellants identify Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC and the United States of America as represented by the United States Department of Energy as the Real Party in Interest (App. Br. 3). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Specification discloses a system of capturing and amplifying nucleic acids: The system comprises introducing a sample potentially containing the nucleic acid into a packed bed wherein the nucleic acid adheres to the packed bed, introducing the amplification mix, typically nucleic acid mix, into the packed bed, and thermal cycling the packed bed and the nucleic acid between denaturation and annealing temperatures for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification.  (Spec. 4, \\xb6 0010.)  \\u201c[A]mplifying the nucleic acid while bound to the beads can improve the limit of detection of an assay by an order of magnitude.  In the case of low copy number samples the probability of a successful reaction is dramatically increased when processed through a packed bed and amplified on the beads.\\u201d  (Spec.  5, \\xb6 0012.)   Claims 1-10 are on appeal, and can be found in the Claims Appendix (App. Br. 48-49).  Claim 1 is representative of the claims on appeal, and reads as follows: Claim 1. A packed bed apparatus for DNA capture and amplification of a sample wherein the sample contains nucleic acid and contaminants, comprising: [1] a tubing or housing having a cavity, [2] bed media in said cavity that receives the sample containing nucleic acid and contaminants, [3] a wash solution in said packed bed for washing away the contaminants, [4] an amplification mix in said packed bed, [5] amplification markers in said packed bed, and [6] a heater operatively connected to said tubing or housing for thermal cycling said packed bed and said sample containing the nucleic acid between denaturation, annealing, and extension temperatures for nucleic acid amplification producing amplified nucleic acid in said packed bed. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  3  The following grounds of rejection are before us for review: The Examiner has rejected claims 1-10 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112 first paragraph as lacking written descriptive support. The Examiner has rejected claims 1-10 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Gerdes2 as evidenced by Kim,3 Singh,4 Atwood,5 Mehta,6 Gardon,7 Adams,8 and Minter.9 The Examiner has rejected claims 1-10 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Wheeler,10 Gerdes as evidenced by Kim, Singh, Atwood, Mehta, Gardon, Adams, and Minter.  I. The Issue:  Written Description The Examiner takes the position that there is insufficient descriptive support for \\u201ca wash solution in said packed bed for washing away the contaminants, an amplification mix in said packed bed, [and] amplification markers in said packed bed\\u201d where all elements are simultaneously present in the packed media bed as currently recited in claim 1 (Ans. 7-8.)  The Examiner\\u2019s position is that \\u201cno written description is found for the claimed                                            2 John C.

The issue is:  Does the originally filed disclosure have descriptive support for the combination of elements as recited in the claim?  Findings of Fact  FF 1.  The Specification discloses a packed bed for DNA capture and amplification system having the following steps In Step 1, the dirty sample is introduced to the packed bed in the presence of chaotropic salt/binding agents.  DNA adheres to the packed bed matrix. In Step 2, contaminants are washed away. In Step 3, a PCR mix is introduced to the packed bed/thermal chamber. . . . In Step 4, amplification markers are released for detection.  For example, etags are released during amplification. In Step 5, amplified DNA is eluted.  By alternating flow directions clogging of the packed bed is minimized. (Spec. 14-15: \\xb6 0032.)   Principle of Law [T]he hallmark of written description is disclosure\\u2026. [T]he test requires an objective inquiry into the four corners of the specification from the perspective of a person of ordinary skill in the art.  Based on that inquiry, the specification must describe an invention understandable to that skilled artisan and show that the inventor actually invented the invention claimed.  Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Co., 598 F.3d 1336, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2010). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  5  Analysis Appellants \\u201cassert that the wash solution, an amplification mix, and amplification markers can be in the packed bed at different times without violating 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112, first paragraph.\\u201d  (App. Br. 12, see also Reply Br. 4.)   We do not agree with Appellants\\u2019 contention that the wash solution, amplification mix, and amplification markers can be found in the packed bed at different times and still meet the claim limitation.  We agree with the Examiner\\u2019s position that the claims are directed to a product - a packed bed apparatus - and not a kit, as such the claimed apparatus requires that the wash solution, and amplification mix and amplification markers are present at the same time.  Appellants direct us to Fig 1B, reproduced below, of the Specification as providing support that at some point in the process disclosed by the method steps depicted in the figure \\u201cthe wash solution, amplification mix, and amplification markers are all found in combination in the packed bed.\\u201d  (App. Br. 13.)   \\x0c\\nAppApp showcolumampaddinhavewashampwithfor aeal 2012-0lication 12The descws that the mn, the amlification mng the ampe wash soluh solution wlification mh Appellanta packed be002307 2/899,924 criptive supwash solumplificationmarkers, diplification ution and awill remainmix.

However, we note that the only time the packed bed apparatus contains the wash solution, amplification mix and amplification markers at the same time, as required by the product claim, is after the DNA has already been added.  In essence, the descriptive support is for a used column.  Because the Specification does provide descriptive support for a used column having wash solution, amplification mix, and amplification markers we reverse the written description rejection.     II. The Issue: Obviousness over Gerdes in view of multiple references The Examiner takes the position that Gerdes teaches a packed bed column for capture and amplification of DNA (Ans. 10).  The Examiner acknowledges that Gerdes does not specifically recite \\u201camplification markers\\u201d or a heater \\u201coperatively linked to the tubing or housing of the packed bed.\\u201d  (Ans. 10-11.)  The Examiner looks to Minter for teaching a heater and finds that the reference disclosed: an apparatus for amplification of nucleic acids in a sample on a solid phase (see Abstract) comprising preassembled and interconnected components of column/tubing with two solid phases one having bound X primer and the other having bound Y primer, buffers, nucleotides, and wash solution as illustrated in Figure 1 (and see Figure 1). Thus Minter et al. teach an amplification mix which is primers on the solid support in a column which is a type of housing having a cavity and which receives the sample of nucleic acids (see Figure 1 and see claim 1). Minter et al. also teach that contaminants are washed from the column of the apparatus (see paragraph 0052). And Minter et al. teach a heater [that] is also provided for heating the column of the apparatus as necessary. (Ans. 12.)  The Examiner finds that \\u201cSingh et al. teach and PCR amplification reaction in a master mix containing entity tags \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  8 probes/amplification which are markers E-TAG \\u2122 probes/amplification markers.\\u201d  (Ans. 14.) With respect to the combination of Gerdes, Minter, and Singh the Examiner concludes that: It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the claimed invention was made to modify the packed bed with thermal cycling of Gerdes et al. by having a heater operatively linked to the tube or column housing of the packed bed as suggested by Singh et al. and as suggested by Minter et al. with a reasonable expectation of success. The motivation to introduce use a thermal cycler/heater is provided by Singh et al. who teach the thermal cycler is programmed for repeated cycles of controlled temperature and time (see paragraph 0436).  Thus, the claimed invention as a whole was prima facie obvious over the combined teachings of the prior art. (Ans. 14- 15.)   The Examiner notes, and Appellants do not dispute (App Br. 13), \\u201cthat by adding other claimed elements of wash solution, amplification mix, and amplification markers sequentially to the packed bed, some remainder of each of those other elements might be present in the packed bed simultaneously so that a packed bed would comprise [any of] these other elements\\u201d (Ans. 9).  As discussed above in I, a used column would not only contain nucleic acids but would also contain wash solution, amplification mix and amplifications markers.   The issue is: Does the preponderance of the evidence of record support the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that a column that functions to capture and amplify nucleic acids would have been obvious given the combined teachings of Gerdes, Minter and Singh?   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  9 Findings of Fact  The Examiner made extensive specific findings for each of the claims on appeal, in each case supporting the finding by tying it to a specific disclosure in the cited references (Ans. 9-17, 30-35).  The following merely highlights some of these findings:  FF 2.  Gerdes disclosed binding DNA to \\u201c[a]luminum oxide beads (74-149 \\u03bcm size), obtained from Aldrich (catalog no. 34,265-3).\\u201d  (Gerdes col. 7, ll. 39-40; Ans. 10.)   FF 3. Gerdes disclosed that: Binding is permitted either by rotation in a closed microfuge tube or by gravity flow filtration.  Large beads readily settle to the bottom of the tube without centrifugation and therefore facilitate washing.  For gravity flow experiments a Spectrum SpectraMesh 43 \\u03bcm filter (Spectrum, catalog no. 146530) is pressure fit into an ANSYS 4 mM chromatography column.  The aluminum oxide beads are packed into this column as a liquid slurry, allowed to drain, blotted dry, washed once with 1 ml 70% ETOH and dried, prior to adding the DNA in the various binding buffers.  (Gerdes col. 7, ll. 45-55; Ans. 11.)  FF 4.  Gerdes disclosed that \\u201c[r]adiolabeled DNA is allowed to bind during gravity filtration of either 74-149 \\u03bcm aluminum oxide beads or 150-212 \\u03bcm silicon dioxide beads (Sigma, catalog no. G1145).\\u201d  (Gerdes col. 8, ll. 62-65; Ans. 11.) FF 5. Gerdes disclosed solid phase amplification of DNA samples bound to the aluminum oxide beads (Gerdes col. 9, l. 31 to col. 10, l. 31, Example 4.)  FF 6. Gerdes disclosed PCR tubes having aluminum oxide adhered to via silicone or any other means (Gerdes col. 12, ll. 3-5; Ans. 10).  \\x0c\\nAppApp (Ger colum(MincentrPA ansupptherecolumeal 2012-0lication 12[A] probinding specimewaste, 3then asamplificrdes col. 12FF 7.

The hybridisation reaction traps the sequences of interest. . . . The particles are then washed to remove excess reagent. . . . Enzymes and nucleotides are added to the column (there is the possibility that this may be performed simultaneously with the primers). (Minter 8: \\xb6\\xb6 0052-0055; Ans. 12)  FF 9. Minter disclosed \\u201cthat the solid supports are packed into a column into and from which liquids may be readily introduced and removed. The use of such a column enables reagents (e.g. hybridisation buffers, nucleotide) to be readily introduced into the reaction system.\\u201d  (Minter 10: \\xb6 0012; Ans. 12.)   FF 10.  Minter disclosed that \\u201c[t]he supports were retained in position by two frits located 10 mm apart.\\u201d  (Minter 10: \\xb6 0072; Ans. 13.)  FF 11.  Singh disclosed a singleplex PCR reaction using a master mix in conjunction with primers and e-tag probes for at least 40 PCR cycles.  (Singh 35: \\xb6 0436; see also 34: \\xb6 0434; Ans. 15.) FF 12.  The Examiner finds that Adams in addition to specifically reciting latex beads pre-packed in a vessel (Ans. 11; Adams col. 8, ll. 42-46) also recites alternative supports such as \\u201cbeads, particles, dipsticks, fibers, filters, membranes and silane or silicate supports such as glass\\u201d (Ans. 11; Adams col. 1, ll. 51-53)  FF 13.  Kim disclosed a \\u201cpurely mechanical lysis method, [using] spherical particles (beads) in a lysis chamber micro fabricated in a CD, [to] cause disruption of mammalian (CHO-K1).\\u201d  (Kim Abstract; Ans. 11)  \\u201cTwo sizes of glass beads were used, the first was approximately 106 \\u03bcm in \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  12 diameter (Sigma, G-4649) and the second ranged from 150 to 212 \\u03bcm (Sigma, G-1145).\\u201d  (Kim p. 520, 3rd full paragraph; Ans. 11.)

The microscale system structure includes using: [P]olymer beads, silica beads, ceramic beads, clay beads, glassbeads, magnetic beads, metallic beads, inorganic beads, and organic beads can be used.  The particles can have essentially any shape, e.g., spherical, helical, irregular, spheroid, rodshaped, cone-shaped, disk shaped, cubic, polyhedral or a combination thereof.  Particles are optionally coupled to reagents, affinity matrix materials, or the like, e.g., nucleic acid synthesis reagents, peptide synthesis reagents. . . . (Mehta col. 3, ll. 3-10; Ans. 15.)  FF 15.  Gardon disclosed that \\u201c[t]o prevent glass beads from dropping into the tygon tubing, a small piece of stainless steel screen is placed in the tubing.\\u201d  (Gardon 1625; Ans. 17.)

If that burden is met, the burden of coming forward with evidence or argument shifts to the applicant.\\u201d  In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992):     \\u201cIn determining whether obviousness is established by combining the \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  13 teachings of the prior art, the test is what the combined teachings of the references would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art.\\u201d  In re GPAC Inc., 57 F.3d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (internal quotations omitted).  Analysis  Appellants contend that \\u201cthat the Examiner has not provided reasons for combining the nine (9) references to produce the proposed structural elements.\\u201d  (App. Br. 19.)  \\u201cThe primary Gerdes reference does not show, disclose, teach, or suggest the claim elements and claim limitations: \\u201ca wash solution in said packed bed for washing away the contaminants,\\u201d and/or \\u201can amplification mix in said packed bed,\\u201d and/or \\u201camplification markers in said packed bed\\u201d of Appellants' claims 1-10\\u201d  (App. Br. 17).  Appellants also contend that Gerdes does not teach a heater (App. Br. 18).  In addition, Appellants contend that the Examiner has not provided a valid reason for combining the references (App. Br. 23). As an initial matter we note that how the references are put together (A in view of B, or B in view of A, or the designation of a primary and secondary reference) is immaterial, as it is the combination together that is important.  Our reviewing Court has found \\u201cthat such differing forms of expression did not constitute different grounds of rejection, were of little consequence, and that basing arguments on them was \\u2018attempting to make a mountain out of a mole-hill.\\u2019\\u201d  In re Bush, 296 F.2d 491 496 (CCPA 1961)(citing In re Cowles, 156 F.2d 551, 554 (CCPA 1946)).  See also In re Gorman, 933 F.2d 982, 986 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (affirming obviousness rejection over thirteen references and stating that \\u201c[t]he criterion ... is not the \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  14 number of references, but what they would have meant to a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention.\\u201d).  Appellants contend that \\u201c[a] \\u2018chromatography column\\u2019 is a system used for separating mixtures by virtue of differences in absorbency.  This is different from the apparatus of Appellants' claims 1-10 which provides DNA capture and amplification of a sample.\\u201d  (App. Br. 17, 20, 22.)    We are not persuaded by Appellants\\u2019 contention that chromatography column necessarily separates by absorbency.  A chromatography column is a tube that can hold a number of different matrixes.  Depending on the matrix used, the column can function to separate by size or it can function to separate by affinity.  Appellants have not provided any persuasive evidence or reasoning why the ANSYS 4 mM chromatography column with aluminum oxide beads (FF 1), necessarily separates by absorbency and is not capable of binding DNA. Appellants summarize the teaching of Gerdes (App. Br. 15-16) and list the remaining \\u201csecondary references\\u201d (id. at 16).  Appellants in essence contend every factual finding made by the Examiner and every combination made by the Examiner to be \\u201cin error,\\u201d and contend that the \\u201creferences fail to disclose Appellants\\u2019 claim limitations\\u201d (id. at 19) and that the Examiner \\u201chas not provided reasons for combining the nine (9) references to produce the proposed combination of structural elements\\u201d (id.). We are not persuaded.  The Examiner\\u2019s reasoning is fact based and reasonable (Ans. 9-17, 30-35; FFs 2-16).  Appellants, on the other hand have not identified any specific flaws in the Examiner\\u2019s factual finding or reasoning challenging the Examiner\\u2019s determination of obviousness.  For example, Appellants contend that Gerdes does not teach a \\u201ctubing or \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  15 housing having a cavity,\\u201d or for that matter \\u201cbed media contained in the cavity that receives the sample containing nucleic acid and contaminants.\\u201d  (App. Br. 17.)  These statements do not identify or explain any error in the Examiner\\u2019s finding that the aluminum oxide beads in the ANSYS 4 mM chromatography column are packed and capable of binding DNA (FFs 1 & 2).  Appellants\\u2019 remaining assertions of factual error are similarly unsupported.  The Examiner has provided factual findings and sound reasoning to support a determination that persons of ordinary skill in the art would have been prompted to combine the teachings of the prior art to arrive at the invention of claim 1. Appellants have not established error in the Examiner\\u2019s factual findings or rationale sufficient to rebut the Examiner\\u2019s initial determination of obviousness. As Appellants do not argue the claims separately, we focus our analysis on claim 1, and claims 2-10 fall with that claim. 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37 (c)(1)(vii).    III. The Issue: Obviousness over Wheeler, Gerdes and other references The Examiner takes the position that Wheeler teaches a column housing having a packed bed made of silica beads that is used for the purpose of capturing and amplifying DNA (Ans. 18).  According to the Examiner, the reference also teaches \\u201ca wash [solution] by teaching that the DNA while bound is washed (see 3rd sentence on p.5) and amplification reaction mixtures by teaching the DNA is amplified by PCR on the packed bed of the column using phi29 polymerase reaction\\u201d (Ans. 18).  The \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  16 Examiner further finds that \\u201cWheeler et al. necessarily teach heating the packed bed by thermal cycling for PCR (see first four sentences on p. 5), but do not specifically teach a heater operatively linked to the tubing or housing of the packed bed\\u201d (id. at 19.)  The Examiner finds that \\u201cMinter et al. teach an amplification mix which is primers on the solid support in a column which is a type of housing having a cavity and which receives the sample of nucleic acids . . . [and] teach a heater is also provided for heating the column of the apparatus as necessary\\u201d (id. at 20).  The Examiner finds that \\u201cSingh et al. teach and PCR amplification reaction in a master mix containing entity tags probes/amplification which are markers E-TAG \\u2122\\u201d (id. at 23).  The Examiner concludes that: [I]t would have been obvious . . . to modify the packed bed with thermal cycling Wheeler et al. . . . by having a heater operatively linked to the tube or column housing of the packed bed as suggested by Singh et al. and as suggested by Minter et al. with a reasonable expectation of success. The motivation to introduce use a thermal cycler/heater is provided by Singh et al. who teach the thermal cycler is programmed for repeated cycles of controlled temperature and time.   (Id. at 23-24) The issue is: Does the preponderance of the evidence of record support the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion that a column that functions to capture and amplify nucleic acids would have been obvious, given the combined teachings of the cited references?   Findings of Fact  The Examiner made extensive specific findings for each of the claims on appeal, in each case supporting the finding by tying it to a specific \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  17 disclosure in the cited references (Ans. 18-27, 36-41).  The following are provided merely by way of example:   FF 17. Wheeler disclosed: [A] technique that couples the use of whole genome amplification with a packed silica column. The most effective method of sample purification and extraction is to simply mix the cells once in solution using the above swabbing technique with a denaturation solution.  The sample is loaded and bound to the column. While bound, the DNA is then washed and amplified, making use of all the available starting material. After amplification, the sample can be eluted for further analysis. . . . By performing WGA of DNA bound to the silica beads in the column we should have a much lower limit of detection than if the DNA had to first be eluted. (Wheeler 5-6; Ans. 18.)   Analysis  Appellants contend that the Wheeler reference is not prior art against claims 1-10 (App. Br. 27-28, 30).  According to Appellants, the Wheeler reference is not \\u201cprior art\\u201d because the \\u201cWheeler reference is Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory internal document \\u2018UCRL-TR-209651\\u2019 titled Field Deployable DNA analyzer that has the date February 14, 2005 on its face but was not publically available until October 7, 2005.\\u201d  (App. Br. 27.)  Appellants contend that \\u201c\\u2018Elizabeth Wheeler\\u2019 and \\u2018Allen Christian\\u2019 [are] named inventors of the subject application and thus the portion of the UCRL-TR-209651 document by co-authors J. Marion, K. Sorensen, E. Arroyo, G. Vrankovich, C. Hara, and C. Nguyen is not the invention \\u2018by \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  18 another\\u2019 as required to be \\u2018prior invention\\u2019 prior art.\\u201d  (App. Br. 30.) We are not persuaded.  The publication lists a total of eight co-authors, and only two of the co-authors are also inventors.  Because the authorship and inventorship do not coincide, the reference appears to be \\u201cby others\\u201d and thereby available as reference under 35 U.S.C. 102(a).  Appellants allude to the presence of a declaration that shows the co-authors are not co-inventors (App. Br. 30); however, \\u201cAppellants have not particularly identified this declaration and Examiner has not found a declaration to this effect in the record\\u201d (Ans. 37).  Appellants contend that:  The date on a Technical Report is the date of the report and is not the date the Technical Report was released to the public.  The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory technical information department was contacted and after investigation stated: \\u2018UCRL-TR-209651 was an internal document and was not released to \\u2018Documents - On Line\\u2019 and become publically available until October 7, 2005.   (App. Br. 28.)   We recognize, but are not persuaded, by Appellants\\u2019 contention that the reference was only publicly available after the effective filing date of April 19, 2005.  Appellants fail to identify any evidentiary basis on this record that rebuts the Examiner\\u2019s reasoning that \\u201ctwo separate citations list the Technical Report as published earlier on February 9, 2005.  One citation is from EnergyStorm (retrieved online 03/28/2011).  The other citation is from DOE Scientific and Technical Information (retrieved online 04/06/2011 )\\u201d (Ans. 36).  In re Geisler, 116 F.3d 1465, 1471 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Argument of counsel cannot take the place of evidence).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  19 Appellants summarize the teaching of Wheeler (App. Br. 28-29).  Appellants contend that \\u201cWheeler does not contain all the claim elements and claim limitations of Appellants\\u2019 claims 1-10\\u201d (App. Br. 31), with the exception of limitation 3 from claim 1, Appellants merely recite the claims (id. at 31-32).  Appellants contend that \\u201c[t]he nine secondary references could not be obviously combined with the primary Wheeler reference to produce the missing claim limitations and claim elements identified above that are not shown by the primary Wheeler reference.\\u201d  (App. Br. 32.)   The Examiner\\u2019s reasoning is fact-based and reasonable (Ans. 18-27, 36-41).  Appellants, on the other hand, have not identified any specific flaws in the Examiner\\u2019s factual findings or reasoning in challenging the Examiner\\u2019s determination of obviousness.  For example, Appellants contend that Wheeler does not disclose \\u201ca tubing or housing having a cavity\\u201d or  \\u201cbed media in said cavity that receives the sample containing nucleic acid and contaminants (App. Br. 31).  This conclusory statement does not identify or explain any error in the Examiner\\u2019s finding (FF 17) that Wheeler eluted the DNA after amplification on the solid support. Appellants contend that Wheeler does not disclose all the claimed elements and, therefore, \\u201c[t]he nine secondary references could not be obviously combined with the primary Wheeler reference to produce the missing claim limitations and claim elements identified above that are not shown by the primary Wheeler reference.\\u201d (App. Br. 32).  However, Appellants err in attacking the references individually, as the rejection is based on a combination of references.  See In re Merck & Co., Inc., 800 F.2d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1986).  The references cannot be read in isolation, but for what they teach in combination with the prior art as a whole.  See id.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  20 Appellants have made sweeping assertions that \\u201csince the references fail to show the claim limitations of Appellants\\u2019 claims 1-10, there can be no combination of the references that would show Appellants\\u2019 invention.\\u201d  (App. Br. 34)  Appellants, however, do not identify any error in the Examiner\\u2019s finding that Wheeler disclosed a DNA nucleic acid capture, amplification and detection method in a packed silica column (FF 17).  The Examiner\\u2019s reason for combining Wheeler, Gerdes, Adams, Minter and Singh is that: The motivation to introduce use a thermal cycler/heater is provided by Singh et al. who teach the thermal cycler is programmed for repeated cycles of controlled temperature and time (see paragraph 0436). Thus, the claimed invention as a whole was prima facie obvious over the combined teachings of the prior art. (Ans. 23-24.)  Appellants, however, have not provided any persuasive arguments why the combination of references would not arrive at the claimed invention. The Examiner has provided factual findings and sound reasoning to support a determination that persons of ordinary skill in the art would have been prompted to combine the teachings of the prior art to arrive at the invention of claim 1. Appellants have not established error in the Examiner\\u2019s factual findings or rationale sufficient to rebut the Examiner\\u2019s initial determination of obviousness. As Appellants do not argue the claims separately, we focus our analysis on claim 1, and claims 2-10 fall with that claim. 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41.37 (c)(1)(vii).    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-002307 Application 12/899,924  21 SUMMARY We reverse the rejection of claims 1-10 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112 first paragraph as lacking written descriptive support.

PRATS, Administrative Patent Judges.  GRIMES, Administrative Patent Judge.    DECISION ON APPEAL This is an appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 involving claims to a method of making an absorbent article, which have been rejected for obviousness.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We reverse.                                             1 Appellants identify the Real Party in Interest as McNeil-PPC (Appeal Br. 2). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003231  Application 11/589,590   2  STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Specification states that disposable absorbent articles having a skin care composition on their body-facing surface are desirable (Spec. 1:12-23) but \\u201cessentially dry particulate skin care compositions . . . cannot be effectively retained in the article during manufacture causing the material to be prematurely released\\u201d (id. at 2:19-22).  The Specification discloses that a cover layer made from \\u201ca fibrous nonwoven material having a \\u2018tortuousity value\\u2019 in the range of about 0.8 to about 3.0 . . . permit[s] the substrate to effectively retain the particulate skin care material 14 during manufacture yet also effectively transfers the skin care material 14 to the skin during use\\u201d (id. at 9:7-12).  The Specification defines a method of calculating \\u201cTortuousity value (T)\\u201d (id. at 9:13-23).2  Claims 1-10 and 12-31 are on appeal.  Claim 1 is the only independent claim and reads as follows (emphasis added): 1. A method of making a cover material for an absorbent article comprising: providing a fibrous nonwoven substrate formed from a plurality of constituent fibers, said substrate having a tortuousity value in the range of about 0.8 to about 3.0; conveying said substrate in a machine direction to means for applying a skin care composition; applying a particulate skin care material to said substrate, said particulate skin care comprising a particulate material having a particle size in the range of about 1 micron to about 75 microns, wherein said particulate                                            2 The Specification and claims use the term \\u201ctortuousity value,\\u201d while the Examiner and Appellants use the term \\u201ctortuosity value\\u201d (see, e.g., Answer 6, Appeal Br. 11).  We understand the terms to be synonymous, and use the term \\u201ctortuosity value\\u201d in this opinion. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003231  Application 11/589,590   3  skin care material is not suspended in liquid or dissolved as a solution in liquid; conveying said substrate to means for applying a compressive force to said substrate; applying a compressive force to said substrate to impregnate said substrate with said particulate skin care material, wherein said compressive force is sufficient to impregnate said substrate during manufacturing yet permits the transfer of said particulate material to a body of a user during use of the absorbent article; and wherein a process temperature of said method is less than a melting temperature of said plurality of constituent fibers.  DISCUSSION The Examiner has rejected all of the claims on appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as obvious based on Hasenoehrl,3 Bonneh,4 and Caldwell5 (Answer 5).  The Examiner finds that Hasenoehrl discloses a method meeting most of the limitations of claim 1 (id. at 5-6), but \\u201cdiffers from the claims in that the document fails to disclose a substrate having a tortuosity value of about 0.8 to about 3.0 or addition of particulate matter by compression\\u201d (id. at 6). The Examiner finds that \\u201cBonneh explicitly discloses a tortuosity factor of 1 ([0029], page 3, line 12)\\u201d and Caldwell discloses applying a particulate to a nonwoven fabric by compression (id.).  The Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious to modify Hasenoehrl\\u2019s method \\u201cby addition of particulate matter by compression as taught by Caldwell\\u201d (id.), and that a skilled artisan would have been motivated \\u201cto choose a web having tortuosity of 1 in view of the teachings of Bonneh, disclosing that                                            3 Hasenoehrl et al., US 2004/0242097 A1, Dec. 2, 2004. 4 Bonneh, US 2006/0084344 A1, Apr. 20, 2006. 5 Caldwell, US 5,874,164, Feb. 23, 1999. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003231  Application 11/589,590   4  such materials having enhanced properties such as absorbency ([0015])\\u201d (id. at 7). Appellants argue that \\u201cthe Examiner has failed to establish that Bonneh discloses a material having a tortuosity value as claimed\\u201d (Appeal Br. 11).  Appellants reason that the \\u201cExaminer appears to be concluding that the term \\u2018tortuosity factor\\u2019 set forth in the table of Bonneh (Bonneh, \\xb6 [0029]) is equivalent to the \\u2018tortuosity value\\u2019 set forth in the claimed method\\u201d but \\u201cthe Examiner has not provided any evidence to establish the equivalency of these values\\u201d (id. at 11-12).  In particular, Appellants argue, the Examiner has not \\u201cprovide[d] a sample calculation based upon the formula for \\u2018tortuousity value\\u2019 set forth in the present application to thereby substantiate the Examiner\\u2019s position that these values are equivalent\\u201d (id. at 12). We agree with Appellants that the Examiner has not provided sufficient evidence or sound technical reasoning to support the finding that Bonneh discloses a material having a tortuosity value within the range required by claim 1.  The Specification defines \\u201ctortuousity value\\u201d as follows: \\u201cTortuousity value (T)\\u201d as used herein is a dimensionless value that can be calculated according to the following formula: T = Fr * (Fd/Sd-1)/Sp; where Fr = Fiber Radius in microns (microns); Fd = Fiber Density in grams per meter cubed (g/m3); Sd = Substrate Density (g/m3); and Sp = Average pore size of substrate in microns (microns). Fiber radius (Fr, in microns) is calculated according to the following formula: \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003231  Application 11/589,590   5  Fr (microns) = [((Fs / 10000 m)/Fd)/3.14]1/2 * 106 ; where Fs = Fiber size in dtex, (note: 1 dtex = 1g/10000 m); and Fd = Fiber density in grams per meter cubed (g/m3). (Spec. 9:13-23.)  The Specification states that the \\u201cabove described formula for Tortuousity was derived from the formulas described in article by Cohen, \\u2018A Wet Pore-Size Model for Coverstock Fabrics\\u2019, Book of Papers: The International Nonwoven Fabrics Conference, INDATEC'90, Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry, pp. 317-330 (1990)\\u201d (id. at 10:1-4). Bonneh discloses \\u201ca nonwoven web material . . . composed of at least two layers, a spunbond fiber layer and a meltblown fiber layer\\u201d (Bonneh 1, \\xb6 1).  Bonneh discloses that the \\u201cnonwoven web material has a mean flow pore size which defines the primary absorbent characteristics provided in the web material, in particular, absorptive capacity, absorptive rate and wicking ability\\u201d (id.). Bonneh discloses that the \\u201ctest method for measurement of the mean flow pore size as described above utilizes a PMI Porometer in accordance with the general F316-89 and ASTM E1294-89 methods. . . .  The PMI CAPWIN test parameters are in the table set forth below.\\u201d  (Id. at 3, \\xb6 29.)  One of the parameters set forth in the table is \\u201cTortuosity Factor  1\\u201d (id.). The Examiner has not pointed to evidence in the record or provided sound technical reasoning to show that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have considered the \\u201cTortuosity factor\\u201d described by Bonneh \\u2013 as a test parameter in a method for measuring mean flow pore size \\u2013 to be the same \\u201cTortuousity value\\u201d defined by the formula shown in the Specification.  The Examiner has not, for example, provided evidence that Tortuosity factor/Tortuousity value are recognized by those in the art to mean the same \\x0c\\nAppeal 2012-003231  Application 11/589,590   6  thing, and specifically to mean the value defined by the formula provided in Appellants\\u2019 Specification.   Appellants\\u2019 Specification, in fact, supports the opposite conclusion.  The Specification states that the disclosed formula was \\u201cderived from the formulas\\u201d described in a prior art article, not that it is the art-accepted method of determining a tortuosity value. The Examiner has argued that \\u201cApplicants failed to provide evidence that there is more than a single formula for calculating tortuosity value known in the art\\u201d (Answer 13).  The Examiner\\u2019s attempt to shift the burden of proof to Appellants, however, is premature.  The Examiner must show a \\u201csound basis\\u201d for concluding that the prior art product meets the claim limitations before Appellants can be put to the burden of showing a difference.  See In re Spada, 911 F.2d 705, 708 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (\\u201c[W]hen the PTO shows sound basis for believing that the products of the applicant and the prior art are the same, the applicant has the burden of showing that they are not.\\u201d).  Here, the Examiner has not provided evidence adequate to support the conclusion that the prior art product meets the disputed limitation of claim 1.

Additionally, nowhere in the claim  states the\\nfunctionality of a common radio frequency combiner and\\nsplitter, further [the claim] does not mention of any radio\\nfrequencies combining/splitting.\\n\\nAns., p. 8 (emphasis omitted). In light of the above, the Examiner \\ufb01nds that:\\nthe claimed RF co111biner/splitter must merely co111bine and split\\ncommunications for multiple radios; and Miller\\u2019s router/switch l4, 22\\ncombines and splits communications for multiple RF \\u2014cl1annel access points\\n18. The Examiner relies on this application of Miller in rejecting all claims.\\nId. atp. 7-l2.\\n\\nln response, Appellants argue:\\n\\n[T]he Examiner  once again fails to show where in Miller the\\n\\u201cEthernet router/server and switching device\\u201d combines and\\nsplits communications. There is no support for the Examiner\\u2019s\\nposition that the \\u201cEthernet router/server and switching device\\u201d\\nis a combiner and splitter other than the Examiner\\u2019s opinion. A\\nswitching device, such as the Ethernet switch 22 of Miller,\\nallows nodes, such as access points 18 and/or Ethernet\\nrouter/server 14, to take turns in point\\u2014to\\u2014point connections. An\\nEthernet switch does not combine communications or split\\ncommunications; rather, an Ethernet switch creates a series ofAppeal 201 l-009053\\nApplication 1 l/473,088\\n\\ninstant networks that contain only the two devices that\\ncommunicate with each other at that particular moment. \\n\\n. [E]ven if an \\u201cEthernet router/server and switching device\\u201d\\ncombined and split so1ne conmiunications (which it does not)\\nthose connnunications are not radio frequency co111111unications.\\nThus, Miller would still fail to anticipate the claimed invention.\\n\\nReply Br., p. l-2.\\n\\nIn light of the above, Appellants contend that Miller\\u2019s router/ switch\\n14, 22 is not an RF combiner/splitter because (i) the router/switch 14, 22\\npasses communications, channel-by-channel, without combining or splitting\\nany such communication/s and, (ii) even assuming arguendo the\\nrouter/switch I4, 22 combines and splits any such communication/s, the\\nrouter/switch 14, 22 would nonetheless fail to combine or split any RF\\nsignal/s. App. Br., p. 4-5; Reply Br., p. 2.\\n\\nEach of Appellants\\u2019 contentions (i) and (ii) supra is persuasive that\\nMiller\\u2019s router/ switch is not an RF combiner/splitter, particularly for the\\nreasons provided by Appellants\\u2019 above block-quoted argument. Though\\nneither the independent claims 1, 6, and ll nor Appellants\\u2019 Speci\\ufb01cation\\nexpressly defines an RF combiner/splitter, the present application\\u2019s\\nconsistently disclosed con\\ufb01guration of an RF con1biner/ splitter (connecting\\nradios to an antenna) and a review of U.S. patents (not of record) persuade\\nus that an RF combiner/splitter is understood in the art as combining and\\nsplitting RF signals.

ISSUE\\n\\nThe dispositive issue before us is whether the Examiner has erred in\\ndetermining that the combination oflaenke and Eshelman teaches or would\\nhave suggested a method \\u201cwhere the steps of entering and presenting are\\naccomplished with the user interface and a control system of the personal\\n111obility vehicle, where the user imeijface and the control system are used\\nalso for controlling and causing movement of the personal nzobilily vehicle\\u201d\\n\\n(claim 1, emphasis added).\\n\\nIll. FTNDINGS OF FACT\\nThe following Findings of Fact (FF) are shown by a preponderance of\\nthe evidence.\\nJaenke\\n1. J aenl<e discloses a method and power driven wheelchair 30\\n\\nincluding a system controller 32 having a user interface device and displayAppeal 2011-005037\\nApplication 1 l/906,405\\n\\nthat controls a drive controller 34 in response to activation of an input device\\nor software programs (\\ufb02 [0O45]).\\nEs/7e/mcm\\n\\n2. Eshelman discloses a personal object, such as a wheelchair,\\nhaving an integrated electronic function within its housing 10 that includes a\\npersonal digital assistant (PDA) which stores and retrieves appointments and\\nmay be programmed to store and retrieve addresses and phone numbers,\\ncalendar events, and memos, to-do lists, etc. (col. 3, ll. 10-17 and 39-45:).\\n\\n3. Upon the occurrence of the event, the PDA will sound a\\nreminder or display a reminder on the user interface (col. 4, 11. 8-12).\\n\\nVong\\n\\n4. Vong discloses a handheld co111puting device which, when it\\ntimes out and receives an alarm, will repeat the alarm until the user\\nacknowledges the notice (col. 8, 11. 19-64). ln particular, a taskbar\\nannunciator for a calendar application will be displayed upon the opening of\\nthe handheld computing device, displaying the notices that were actuated\\n\\nduring the time wl1entl1e device was deactivated (z\\'a\\u2019.).\\n\\nlV. ANALYSIS\\nClaims 1-3, 6-8, 10, 13-15, I 7, and 20\\nAppellants contend that \\u201cthere is no disclosure or suggestion of\\nintegrating the electronic assistant into any of the operational functions of\\n\\n777\\n\\nthe \\u2018personal objects (App. Br. 6\\u201c). Appellants argue that since Jaenl<e \\u201chas\\nan electronic control and user interface for that control [and] not a non-\\n\\nelectronic personal object which Eshelman  is intended for,\\u201d \\u201cit does notAppeal 2011-005037\\nApplication 1 l/906,405\\n\\nappear obvious to combine the teachings of Eshel111an  into the wheelchair\\nofJaenke\\u201d (App. Br. 6).\\n\\nHowever, the Examiner \\ufb01nds that \\u201cJaenke discloses a motorized\\nwheelchair comprising a user interface that controls the movement of the\\nwheelchair\\u201d and \\u201cEshelman teaches a wheelchair co111prising an integrated\\ndevice capable of entering and presenting reminders\\u201d (Ans. l3). The\\nExaminer notes further that \\u201c[a]n electronic wheelchair and a non\\u2014electronic\\nwheelchair are in the same \\ufb01eld of endeavor and are reasonably pertinent to\\nthe particular problem with which the [A]ppellant[s] w[ere] concerned\\u201d\\n(Ans. 14). Thus, \\u201ca person of ordinary skill in the art would in the \\ufb01eld of\\nwheelchairs to solve the problem of presenting reminders to wheelchair\\nusers\\u201d (ia\\u2019.).\\n\\nJ aenl<e is directed to a method for a power driven wheelchair\\nincluding a system controller having a user interface device and display that\\ncontrols a drive controller in response to activation of an input device or\\nsoftware programs (FF 1\\u201c). We \\ufb01nd that J aenl<e\\u2019s method for controlling the\\npower driven wheelchair includes entering infon11ation into the power driven\\nwheelchair where the control syste111 (drive controller) controls movement of\\nthe power driven wheelchair.\\n\\nIn addition, Eshelman discloses a wheelchair having an integrated\\nelectronic function within its housing that includes a PDA, which stores and\\nretrieves appointments that may be programmed to store and retrieve\\naddresses and phone numbers, calendar events, and memos, to-do lists (FF\\n2). Upon the occurrence of the event, the PDA sounds a reminder or\\ndisplays one on the user interface (FF 3\\u201c). We \\ufb01nd that the programming?\\n\\nEshelman\\u2019s wheelchair including the PDA comprises and entering\\n\\n\\u2018J:Appeal 2011-005037\\nApplication 1 l/906,405\\n\\ninformation step and presenting a reminder step that are accomplished using\\na user interface (PDA) and a control system (PDA).\\n\\nWe \\ufb01nd that the co111bined teachings of.laenke and Eshelman at least\\nsuggest all the contested claim limitations of claim l.\\n\\nWe also agree with the Examiner\\u2019s explicit motivation that co111bining\\nthe references would have been obvious since \\u201cto improve the personal\\nVehicle with reasonable expectation  [which] would result in personal\\n111obility vehicle in which an electronic reminder system is conveniently\\nlocated near the user\\u201d (Ans. 5). The Supreme Court has stated that \\u201c[t]he\\ncombination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be\\nobvious when it does no more than yield predictable results.\\u201d KSR Int \\u2019l Co.\\nv. Te/e\\ufb02ex 1170., 550 U.S. 398, 416 (2007).\\n\\nThus, we \\ufb01nd no error in the Exa1niner\\u2019s \\ufb01nding that the combination\\nof J aenl<e\\u2019s power driven wheelchair (including a syste111 and drive\\ncontroller) that that receives user input for controlling the wheelchair with\\nthe PDA, as disclosed in Eshelman, produces a method to operate a\\nmotorized personal mobility Vehicle where the steps of entering information\\nand presenting information are accomplished using the user interface and the\\ncontrol syste111 which would be obvious (Ans.5; FF 1-3,).\\n\\nAccordingly, we \\ufb01nd no error in the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1\\nunder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 l03(a) over Jaenke over Eshelman. Appellants present a\\nsimilar argument for independent claims 8 and 15 having similar claim\\nlanguage. Thus, claims 8 and 15 and claims 2, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, and 20\\n(depending fro111 claims 1, 8, and 15) wl1icl1 have not been argued separately,\\n\\nfall with claim 1.Appeal 201 l-005037\\nApplication 1 l/906,405\\n\\nClaim 3\\n\\nAppellants contend that even though \\u201c[t]he [E]xaminer stated that\\nhaving a dealer input triggering information, as opposed to a user entering\\nthe information, is not outside the scope of one of ordinary skill in the art,\\u201d\\nthis is not the test for patentability\\u201d (App. Br. 10).\\n\\nHowever, the Examiner \\ufb01nds that \\u201cJaenke in view of Eshelman\\ndisclose[s] a user entering infon11ation into the personal mobility Vehicle that\\nis indicative of a reminder to be generated upon the occurrence of a\\ntriggering event\\u201d (Ans. l6). Thus, \\u201c[i]t would be obvious to one of ordinary\\nskill in the art for a dealer to input triggering input into a device or a user to\\ninput triggering device\\u201d (id.).\\n\\nAs noted supra, Eshelman discloses a wheelchair having an integrated\\nelectronic function within its housing that includes a PDA which stores and\\nretrieves appointments that may be programmed to store and retrieve\\naddresses and phone numbers, calendar events, and memos, to-do lists (FF\\n2). Where upon the occurrence of tlie event, the PDA sounds a reminder or\\ndisplays one on the user interface (FF 3). We \\ufb01nd that the user input for the\\nPDA comprises input from any user, including a dealer.\\n\\nWe find that the co111bined teaching of J aenke and Eshel111an would at\\nleast suggest the contested features of claim 3.\\n\\nAccordingly, we \\ufb01nd no error in the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 3\\nunder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103 (a) over J aenl<e in view of Eshelman.

DECISION ON APPEAL          \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004870 Application 10/448,235   2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from a final rejection of claims 1-11.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b). We affirm.  THE INVENTION Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention is directed to fragmenting multimedia data associated with navigation nodes.  Abstract. Independent claim 1, reproduced below, is representative of the subject matter on appeal. 1.  Method of fragmenting multimedia data associated with navigation nodes comprising the steps of: grouping at least one navigation node and data associated with said at least one node into a temporary cell, wherein each navigation node from said at least one navigation node additionally controlling identifying data that is capable of being used to identify a navigation node that comes after said navigation node and said temporary cell comprises: a starting node, and the data associated with said starting node where said starting node is from said at least one navigation node, and a navigation node which is after said starting node, where said temporary cell is filled with additional navigation nodes that are sequentially after said navigation node that comes after said starting node, until the size of said temporary cell reaches a threshold value and forming a definite cell by selecting a pair of navigation nodes from said temporary cell wherein said pair of navigation nodes sequentially follow each other as to be a first node and a second node and said pair of navigation nodes have a number of data that is common, where a parameter, that is dependent on said number of data, is minimized during said forming step.    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004870 Application 10/448,235   3 REFERENCE and REJECTIONS 1. The Examiner rejected claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112, second paragraph, as being indefinite. 2. The Examiner rejected claims 1-11 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as being anticipated by Applicant\\u2019s Admitted Prior Art (hereinafter AAPA).  ISSUES  The issues are whether the Examiner erred in finding that: 1. claim 1 is indefinite; and 2. AAPA teaches the limitation of \\u201cforming a definite cell by selecting a pair of navigation nodes from said temporary cell wherein said pair of navigation nodes sequentially follow each other as to be a first node and a second node and said pair of navigation nodes have a number of data that is common, where a parameter, that is dependent on said number of data, is minimized during said forming step\\u201d as recited in claim 1. ANALYSIS Indefiniteness Appellants have not responded to the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 112.  We agree with the Examiner that the claim 1 limitation of \\u201cat least one node\\u201d into a temporary cell could comprise a single node and it is inconsistent with the claim 1 recitation of a temporary cell comprising \\u201ca starting node\\u201d and \\u201ca navigation node which is after [the] starting node\\u201d thereby comprising at least two nodes (Ans. 7).  Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claim 1 as indefinite.    \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004870 Application 10/448,235   4 Anticipation Appellants argue that the AAPA fails to disclose at least the selection of navigation nodes from a temporary cell and the minimization of a parameter during the formation of the definite cell (Br. 7).  We do not agree.  We agree with the Examiner that the AAPA teaches neighboring nodes and data being formed into a cell (Spec. 1:27- 3:14; Ans. 8).  We further agree with the Examiner that the AAPA teaches (Spec. 2:29 -3:1) fragmentation of a set of data into formed cells by considering the quantity of data included in a cell as a fragmentation parameter (Ans. 8).  The data cell is generated by grouping neighboring data from neighboring nodes into a cell until the latter (i.e., cell) reaches a given size, fragmenting data into cells by considering the quantity of data included in a cell as fragmentation parameter, until the latter is minimized (Ans. 8).  Thus, we agree with the Examiner that the AAPA teaches forming data cells (i.e., forming a definite cell) by grouping identical or redundant data from neighboring nodes (i.e., by selecting a pair of navigation nodes) having identical or redundant data (i.e., a number of data that is common) by considering the quantity of data reaching a given size included in a cell as a fragmentation parameter (i.e., the parameter dependent on the number of data is minimized during forming). Accordingly, we affirm the Examiner\\u2019s rejections of claim 1 and for the same reasons, the rejections of claims 2-11, which were not separately argued.      \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-004870 Application 10/448,235   5 CONCLUSIONS  The Examiner did not err in finding that: 1. claim 1 is indefinite; and 2. AAPA teaches the limitation of \\u201cforming a definite cell by selecting a pair of navigation nodes from said temporary cell wherein said pair of navigation nodes sequentially follow each other as to be a first node and a second node and said pair of navigation nodes have a number of data that is common, where a parameter, that is dependent on said number of data, is minimized during said forming step\\u201d as recited in claim 1.  DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting claims 1-11 is affirmed.  No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iv).   AFFIRMED             gw \\x0c'},\n",

SCHEINER, DEMETRA J. MILLS, and  JEFFREY N. FREDMAN, Administrative Patent Judges.  SCHEINER, Administrative Patent Judge.  DECISION ON APPEAL This is an appeal1 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 from the final rejection of claims 15-17, 19, 21, and 26-32, directed to a method of treating pre-cancerous skin lesions in mammals.  The claims have been rejected as obvious.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).  We reverse.                                            1  Appellant identifies the Real Party-In-Interest as Berry Pharmaceuticals, LLC (App. Br. 3).  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004387 Application 12/661,567  2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE  Claims 15-17, 19, 21, and 26-32 are pending and on appeal.  Claims 1-14, 22-25, 33, and 41-44 have been withdrawn from consideration as \\u201cdrawn to nonelected inventions and species\\u201d (Final Rej. 2).2   In addition, we note that Appellant elected the species \\u201cpre-cancerous lesions\\u201d for examination on the merits, without traverse, in the Response to Election/Restriction dated January 10, 2011.  Accordingly, it is our understanding that the claims have been examined only to the extent they read on the elected species: pre-cancerous lesions (see Final Rej. 4).   Claim 15 is representative of the subject matter on appeal, and is reproduced below: 15. A method for treating a disorder present in or on a mammalian subject which method comprises contacting a composition containing a Hamelia patens extract to the skin of said subject in an effective amount and frequency for reducing symptoms of a disorder selected from the group consisting of: pre-cancerous lesions, keratotic lesions and radiation-induced burns.

Declaration of Dr. Debabrata Saha, submitted under the provisions of         37 C.F.R. \\xa71.132, dated July 18, 2012 (Saha Decl.\\u201d). The Examiner rejected the claims as unpatentable under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 103(a) as follows:  Claims 15-17, 19, 21, 26, and 30-32 over Taylor and Einspahr (Final Rej. 3-8). Claims 15, 27, and 28 over Taylor, Einspahr, and Herzog (Final Rej. 8-9). Claims 15 and 29 over Taylor, Einspahr, and Mentrup Edgar (Final Rej. 9-11).   FINDINGS OF FACT The following findings of fact (FF) are supported by a preponderance of the evidence of record. Taylor  1. Taylor discloses that the main actions attributed to the leaves and stems of Hamelia patens are \\u201canalgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, febrifuge (reduces fever), refrigerant (reduces body temperature)\\u201d (Taylor 144, col. 3), and the main topical uses of the plant include \\u201cas a topical anti-inflammatory and analgesic (pain-reliever) remedy for skin problems \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004387 Application 12/661,567  4  (rashes, bites, stings, etc.) and for bruises, strains, muscle aches, sprains, etc.\\u201d and \\u201cas a topical astringent, antiseptic, and antimicrobial remedy for wounds, cuts, burns, skin fungi, etc.\\u201d (id. at 144, col. 4).  2. Taylor also teaches that Hamelia patens \\u201chas also been documented with diuretic effects and was shown to inhibit the growth of tumor and bacteria cells\\u201d (Taylor 419), citing L\\xf3pez Abraham (number 15 in Taylor\\u2019s bibliography) as evidence of anti-tumor activity of Hamelia patens.  3. L\\xf3pez Abraham discloses that aqueous, alcohol, and ketone extracts of Hamelia patens exhibit cytostatic activity against Neurospora crassa, a type of bread mold (L\\xf3pez Abraham 1-3).  4. Finally, Taylor reports the use of Hamelia patens \\u201cfor cancer\\u201d in the Amazonia region (Taylor 419).  However, Taylor does not specify what type of cancer[s] Hamelia patens is used to treat, or whether the plant is used topically or ingested.  The Fuller, Stetson, Hobson, and Saha Declarations  5. Dr. Fuller, after reviewing the English language translation of the L\\xf3pez Abraham article, cited in Taylor, asserts that \\u201cthe statement of percentage inhibition by Hamelia patens therein was made solely in reference to the growth rate of a line of cells . . . of the plant Neurospora crassa\\u201d (Fuller Decl. \\xb6\\xb6 7, 9), and that It is my professional opinion that all credible researchers realize that knowledge of a particular material having cytostatic/cytotoxic activity with respect to particular cells . . . of one particular plant species, would not be reasonably interpreted or extrapolated as indicating that the same particular material would exhibit the same effect in any dermal cell lines of any mammalian species, and that cytostatic/cytotoxic activity in the kingdom Plantae does not imply direct corollary activity in animal models.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004387 Application 12/661,567  5  (Id. at \\xb6 10).   Drs. Stetson, Hobson, and Saha make similar statements in their Declarations (see \\xb6\\xb6 11, 12 of the Stetson Decl.; \\xb6\\xb6 15-17 of the Hobson Decl.; and \\xb6\\xb6 9, 10 of the Saha Decl.).     Einspahr  6. According to Einspahr, \\u201c[c]ancer chemoprevention strategies, if effective, could prevent or delay the occurrence of cancer in high-risk populations, such as those with premalignant lesions\\u201d (Einspahr 273, col. 1), like premalignant actinic keratosis (AK) (id. at 270, col. 2). DISCUSSION  There are three obviousness rejections, each based, in whole or in part, on the Examiner\\u2019s proposed combination of Taylor and Einspahr.  The issue raised by each of the rejections is whether the Examiner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have been obvious for one of ordinary skill in the art to treat pre-cancerous skin lesions by applying a composition comprising an extract of Hamelia patens, given the teachings of Taylor and Einspahr.   The Examiner finds that Taylor \\u201cdiscloses hamelia patens as having antitumorous properties and having use in humans as a topical remedy to treat \\u2018all types of skin problems,\\u2019 skin disorders, skin diseases, rashes, sores, wounds, burns, and cancer\\u201d and having \\u201cbeen shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells\\u201d (Final Rej. 4).  The Examiner finds that \\u201c[i]t can be prepared as a poultice, decoction, infusion, tincture, tea, or boiled in water (i.e., extract) and . . . applied topically or internally\\u201d (id.).  The Examiner acknowledges that Taylor \\u201cdoes not specifically disclose the disorder as pre-cancerous lesions\\u201d (id.), but finds that Einspahr \\u201ccures the deficiency of Taylor by \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004387 Application 12/661,567  6  teaching treatment of pre-cancerous lesions . . . using chemopreventive natural products in order to reduce the incidence of cancer as well as pre-cancerous lesions\\u201d (id. at 5).  The Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious for one of ordinary skill in the art \\u201cto combine these teachings in order to treat and reduce the incidence of pre-cancerous lesions\\u201d (id.), \\u201cby topically applying to human skin the hamelia patens extract of Taylor\\u201d (id.), because Taylor and Einspahr \\u201care each directed to chemopreventive natural products applied topically\\u201d (id.), and Taylor \\u201cdiscloses hamelia patens as a natural product that inhibits the growth of tumor cells\\u201d (id. at 6).    Appellant contends, in relevant part, that that \\u201cthe words \\u2018all types of skin problems\\u2019, \\u2018antitumorous\\u2019, and \\u2018cancer\\u2019 in the Taylor reference are each broad genus statements of classes . . . and no direction as to relevant particular species [to be treated] within these genera is provided\\u201d (App. Br. 6).  Moreover, Appellant contends that the Saha and Fuller Declarations \\u201crefute the notion that Hamelia patens would be expected to be able to treat \\u2018all types of skin problems\\u2019\\u201d (id. at 8); and that the tumor inhibition discussed in Taylor \\u201crelates to a single line of plant cells and is not extrapolable [sic] to mammals\\u201d (id. at 11), and Taylor does not even specify that the tumors are malignant (id. at 12, 13).  Finally, Appellant contends that Taylor\\u2019s reference to the use of Hamelia patens \\u201cfor cancer\\u201d \\u201cencompass[es] a broad class of conditions\\u201d and \\u201cdoes not lead a person of ordinary skill in the art to . . . envisage any particular mammalian cancer or cancer type\\u201d (id. at 14), and \\u201c[n]o reasonable person would believe that Hamelia patens is capable of treating all cancers\\u201d (id. at 15). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004387 Application 12/661,567  7  We will reverse these rejections.  An obviousness analysis requires, among other things, consideration of two factors:   (1) whether the prior art would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art that they should make the claimed composition or device, or carry out the claimed process; and (2) whether the prior art would also have revealed that in so making or carrying out, those of ordinary skill would have had a reasonable expectation of success.  Both the suggestion and the reasonable expectation of success must be founded in the prior art, not in the applicant\\u2019s disclosure.  In re Vaeck, 947 F.2d 488, 493 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). Taylor\\u2019s reference to \\u201call types of skin problems\\u201d is clearly just a colloquial expression for a wide variety of skin problems, rather than an assertion that that an extract of Hamelia patens can cure every possible type of skin problem.  Nevertheless, we agree with Appellant that Taylor\\u2019s disclosure would not have given one of ordinary skill in the art a reason to treat \\u201cpre-cancerous\\u201d lesions with Hamelia patens in the first place, much less provided one of skill in the art with a reasonable expectation of success, as Taylor lists a wide variety of skin conditions, but none even remotely related to skin cancer or pre-cancerous lesions (FF1).   Moreover, Taylor\\u2019s only reference to tumor inhibition concerns plant cells (FFs 2, 3), and Appellant has provided unrefuted evidence that persons of ordinary skill in the art would not extrapolate data showing cytostatic or cytotoxic activity in plant cells to mammalian cells, as required by claim 15 (FF5).  Similarly, Taylor\\u2019s cursory reference to the ethnomedical use of Hamelia patens \\u201cfor cancer\\u201d in Amazonia and elsewhere (FF4), with no further explanation or citation, would not have suggested treating pre-\\x0c\\nAppeal 2013-004387 Application 12/661,567  8  cancerous skin lesion with Hamelia patens to one of ordinary skill in the art, certainly not with any reasonable expectation of success. Therefore, we cannot agree with the Examiner\\u2019s finding that Taylor teaches or suggests, or is in any way \\u201cdirected to chemopreventive natural products applied topically\\u201d (Final Rej. 5).  Nor can we agree with Examiner\\u2019s finding that Taylor \\u201cdiscloses hamelia patens as a natural product that inhibits the growth of tumor cells\\u201d in mammals as required by claim 15 (id. at 6).  As these findings form the basis of the Examiner\\u2019s rationale for combining the teachings of Taylor and Einspahr, we find the Examiner\\u2019s conclusion of obviousness is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence of record.   The Herzog and Mentrup Edgar references, cited as disclosing topical preparations containing nanoparticles and liposomes, respectively, do not cure the underlying deficiency in the Examiner\\u2019s proposed combination of Taylor and Einspahr.  SUMMARY The rejection of claims 15-17, 19, 21, 26, and 30-32 over Taylor and Einspahr is reversed. The rejection of claims 15, 27, and 28 over Taylor, Einspahr, and Herzog is reversed. The rejection of claims 15 and 29 over Taylor, Einspahr, and Mentrup Edgar is reversed.   REVERSED lp  \\x0c'},\n",

According to Appellant\\u2019s summary of the invention, this arrangement \\u201cprovides current limiting capabilities without requiring the current for powering the . . . operative component during normal operation to flow through the current limiting device.\\u201d  Id. at \\xb6 [0007].   Independent claim 1 is illustrative, with a key disputed limitation emphasized. 1. A base station for use in a wireless communication system, comprising:  a power supply; at least one operative component useful for facilitating wireless communications, the at least one operative component is powered by the power supply; a capacitive stability device in parallel with the at least one operative component; and a current limiting device in series with the capacitive stability device between the power supply and the capacitive stability device, the current limiting device in parallel with the at least one operative component.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007761 Application 11/234,900   3The Examiner relies on the following references as evidence of unpatentability: Gitsevich Van Wonterghem U.S. 6, 225,756 B1  U.S. 2002/0126829 A1May 1, 2001 Sep. 12, 2002 Schaible U.S. 6,980,447 B1 Dec. 27, 2005 Reed U.S. 2006/0025104 A1 Feb. 2, 2006 REJECTIONS The Examiner rejected claims 1-5 and 11-15 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Reed and Van Wonterghem.  Ans., p. 3-5.1 The Examiner rejected claims 6, 10, and 16 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Reed, Van Wonterghem, and Schaible.  Id. at p. 5-6. The Examiner rejected claims 8, 9, 17, and 18 under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Reed, Van Wonterghem, and Gitsevich.  Id. at p. 6-7. ANALYSIS As to illustrative claim 1, the Examiner reads all of the claimed components \\u2013 power supply, operative component, capacitive stability device, and current limiting device \\u2013 on Reed\\u2019s Figure 3 embodiment.  Ans., p. 3-4.  Reed\\u2019s Figure 3 is reproduced below.                                            1 Throughout this opinion, we refer to the Appeal Brief filed August 9, 2010 (\\u201cApp.  Br.\\u201d), Examiner\\u2019s Answer mailed January 31, 2011 (\\u201cAns.\\u201d), and Reply Brief filed March 30, 2011 (\\u201cReply Br.\\u201d). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007761 Application 11/234,900   4 Reed\\u2019s Figure 3 depicts a power supply system cited by the Examiner.  With respect to Reed\\u2019s Figure 3, the Examiner particularly finds that the claimed power supply reads on the power source Vin, the claimed operative component reads on the load 104, the claimed capacitive stability device reads on the capacitor 116, and the claimed current limiting device reads on the switch 110.  Ans., p. 3-4.  The Examiner presents this application of Reed in support of all rejections.  Id. at p. 4-7.  Appellant argues that the switch 110 (claimed current limiting device) is not in parallel \\u2013 but rather in series \\u2013 with the load 104 (claimed operative component), such that the Examiner\\u2019s application of Reed fails to account for the emphasized limitation of reproduced claim 1 (supra, p. 2); that is, fails to teach \\u201cthe current limiting device in parallel with the . . . operative component\\u201d (claim 1).  App. Br., p. 4-6.  In support, Appellant further argues that Reed\\u2019s switch 110 must be considered in series with Reed\\u2019s load 104 because:  \\u201cNo current from the power source Vin can reach the load \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007761 Application 11/234,900   5without first going through the switch 110.  By definition, therefore, the switch 110 is in series with the load 104.\\u201d  Reply Br., p. 1; see also App. Br., p. 4.  Appellant\\u2019s definition of \\u201cin series\\u201d is not disputed by the Examiner.  And, Appellant\\u2019s definition of \\u201cin series\\u201d is reasonable.  Cf., What are \\u201cseries\\u201d and \\u201cparallel\\u201d circuits? Vishay In Stock @ Mouser, All About Circuits; Volume I \\u2013 DC; Series And Parallel Circuits, http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_5/1.html (last visited Oct. 30, 2013). In response to Appellant\\u2019s above \\u201cin series\\u201d definition and argument, the Examiner states:  \\u201cAs similarly recited in \\u2018response to arguments\\u2019 in final rejection filed on 3/4/2010, Van Wonterghem teaches a limiting device 3 (Fig. 1) in parallel with the at least one operative component 2 (Fig. 1).\\u201d  Ans., p. 7.  The Examiner provides no meaningful explanation of why Van Wonterghem\\u2019s cited comparator 3 and equipment 2, or the combination of Van Wonterghem and Reed, teaches or suggests Reed\\u2019s switch 110 and load 104 are in parallel with one another.  Id.  The Examiner merely states:  \\u201cIt is simple substitution to include Van Wonterghem\\u2019s current limiting base station and a limiting device in parallel with a component design into Reed\\u2019s current limiting apparatus to achieve the predictable result of limiting current in an apparatus.\\u201d  Id. at p. 8. We find Appellant\\u2019s above \\u201cin series\\u201d definition and argument to be reasonable, whereas the Examiner\\u2019s determinations and findings are confusing and not meaningfully explained.  On one hand, the Examiner seems to find that all features of the claimed components are taught by Reed\\u2019s cited components, such that the switch 110 (claimed current limiting device) and load 104 (claimed operative component) are found to be in \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007761 Application 11/234,900   6parallel with one another.  Ans., p. 3-4.  On the other hand, the Examiner seems to find that the \\u201cin parallel\\u201d claim feature at issue is met by substituting (or perhaps inserting) \\u201cVan Wonterghem\\u2019s current limiting base station and a limiting device in parallel with a component design into Reed\\u2019s current limiting apparatus.\\u201d  Id. at p. 8.  Because Reed\\u2019s switch 110 and load 104 are not in parallel with one another, and because the Examiner has not reasonably articulated how the \\u201cin parallel\\u201d claim feature at issue is suggested by a combination of Van Wonterghem\\u2019s and Reed\\u2019s teachings, the Examiner fails to establish a teaching or suggestion of the claimed \\u201ccurrent limiting device in parallel with [an] operative component.\\u201d   Before concluding, we note the Examiner\\u2019s further response that: [I]t is unclear whether the current limiting device is in parallel with the operative component or the capacitive stability device is in parallel with the operative component by the language \\u201ca current limiting device in series with the capacitive stability device and in parallel with the at least one operative component\\u201d.  It is unclear by the language exactly which component (or both) is parallel with the operative component and examiner read it as the capacitive stability device being in parallel which was recited earlier in the claim.  Ans., p. 7-8.  Contrary to the Examiner\\u2019s further response, claim 1 recites clear \\u201cin series\\u201d and \\u201cin parallel\\u201d relationships of the power supply, operative component, capacitive stability device, and current limiting device.  According to claim 1, \\u201cthe . . . operative component is powered by the power supply,\\u201d the \\u201ccapacitive stability device [is] in parallel with the . . . operative component,\\u201d and the current limiting device is (i) \\u201cin series with the capacitive stability device between the power supply and the capacitive stability device\\u201d and (ii) \\u201cin parallel with the . . . operative component.\\u201d   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-007761 Application 11/234,900   7In light of the foregoing, we do not sustain the obviousness rejections of:  claims 1-5 and 11-15 over Reed and Van Wonterghem; claims 6, 10, and 16 over Reed, Van Wonterghem, and Schaible; and claims 8, 9, 17, and 18 over Reed, Van Wonterghem, and Gitsevich.

DECISION ON APPEAL\\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011550 Application 11/642,122  2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Appellants seek our review under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134 (2002) of the final rejection of claims 1, 2, 4-27, 29-50, 52, and 53, which are all the claims pending in the application.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b) (2002).    SUMMARY OF THE DECISION We REVERSE.  THE INVENTION  The Appellants\\u2019 claimed invention is directed to a security module of a franking machine for a procedure in data processing (Spec. 1).  Claim 1, reproduced below with the numbering in brackets added, is representative of the subject matter on appeal.  1.  A method for providing at least one secured service via a security module of a franking machine for at least one procedure for data processing that is executed in a data processing device associated with the franking machine, comprising the steps of: [1] in a request step, requesting from the procedure, a secured service from the security module; [2] in a verification step, verifying, in said security module, a non-monetary-based authorization, selected from the group consisting of authorization information linked to said procedure, authorization information linked to said data processing device, and authorization information linked to a user of said procedure, to request said secured service from said procedure; and [3] in a provision step that follows said verification step only if said security module verifies said authorization, providing said secured service from the security module to the procedure.   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011550 Application 11/642,122   3THE REJECTIONS The Examiner relies upon the following as evidence in support of the rejections: Cordery  US 5,796,841    August 18, 1998 Dutta    US 2002/0010640 A1  January 24, 2002  The following rejections are before us for review: 1. Claims 1, 2, 4-10, 16-18, 21, 22, 26, 27, 29-35, 41-43, 46, and 47 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 102(b) as anticipated by Cordery. 2. Claims 11-15, 19, 20, 23-25, 36-40, 44, 45, and 48-50 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as unpatentable over Cordery and Dutta.   FINDINGS OF FACT We find the findings of fact in the Analysis section below are supported at least by a preponderance of the evidence1.  ANALYSIS The Appellants argue that the rejection of claims 1 is improper because the prior art fails to disclose elements of claim limitation [2] (Br. 4-7, Reply Br. 2).   In contrast, the Examiner has determined that the rejection is proper and claim limitation [2] is found in the Abstract, Figures 2 and 3A, col. 1:39-2:12, col. 2:18-29, col. 4:30-57, and col. 6:9-14 (Ans. 3, 12-14).                                            1 See Ethicon, Inc. v. Quigg, 849 F.2d 1422, 1427 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (explaining the general evidentiary standard for proceedings before the Patent Office). \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011550 Application 11/642,122   4We agree with the Appellants.  Claim limitation [2] requires that verification step be a \\u201cnon-monetary-based\\u201d authorization and the Appellants are correct that the cited prior art does require a \\u201cmonetary-based\\u201d verification.  Here, the cited portions Figures 2 and 3A, col. 1:39-2:12, col. 2:18-29, col. 4:30-47, and col. 6:9-14 fail to specifically show such a non-monetary based authorization, and thus the rejection is not sustained.  In Fig. 3A for instance, step 358 shows a step for checking for \\u201csufficient funds\\u201d which would be a \\u201cmonetary-based\\u201d verification as opposed to \\u201cnon-monetary\\u201d based verification.  Figures 4, 5, and 6 also each show such a \\u201cmonetary-based\\u201d verification at steps 404, 504, and 618 respectively.   While Cordery at col. 4:30-57 does disclose a message signed with a private key it is not shown to be as \\u201csecured service\\u201d in a larger \\u201cprocedure\\u201d as it appears only directed to messaging itself, not part of a larger procedure of steps.  Further, it is unclear what the \\u201crequest\\u201d would be in the procedure as the message appears to be sent with the private key before any verification by the recipient.  We find that where the Examiner found that \\u201cthe franking machine of CORDERY is also capable of non-monetary transactions\\u201d (Ans. 13), such capacity is evidence of obviousness rather than anticipation.  For these reasons, the rejection of claims 1 and the rejections of its dependent claims are not sustained.  Independent claim 26 contains a similar limitation and the rejection of this claim and the rejections of its dependent claims are sustained for the same reasons.  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-011550 Application 11/642,122   5CONCLUSIONS OF LAW We conclude that Appellants have shown that the Examiner erred in rejecting the claims as listed in the Rejection section above.        DECISION  The Examiner\\u2019s rejection of claims 1, 2, 4-27, 29-50, 52, and 53 is reversed.    REVERSED                rvb \\x0c'},\n",

We disagree with\\n\\nAppellants.Appeal 2011-005376\\nApplication ll/255,842\\n\\nThe Examiner relies on Honary, not Caronni, for disclosing tl1e\\nclaimed parallel processing feature (Ans. 8. 29-31). Further, Honary\\ndiscloses \\u201cthe separate data streams may be mutually exclusive, and other\\nembodiments, the separate data streams may not be mutually exclusive. For\\nexample, a data stream may be broken into non\\u2014overlapping seg111ents that\\nare mutually exclusive. where each non-overlapping segment is sent to one\\nof PE], PE2. PE3. or PE4.\\u201d (Honary, 1] [0027]). In other words. contrary to\\nAppellants\\u2019 argument (App. Br. 16), Honary does not teach away from the\\nparallel processing of \\u201cdifferent portions of a stream.\\u201d Rather, Honary\\nspeci\\ufb01cally discloses parallel processing non\\u2014overlapping segments\\u2014i.e.,\\n\\u201cdifferent portions\\u201da)f a stream.\\n\\nMoreover. we disagree with Appellants\\u2019 arguments that Caronni\\nteaches away from these features. Although Caronni discloses \\u201cload-\\nbalancing techniques are of limited use\\u201d (Caronni. 11 [0006]), this does not\\nteach away from parallel processing, but merely notes certain shortcomings\\nof load-balancing techniques, such as parallel processing, that are addressed\\nby Caronni\\u2019s inventive progressive processing. Appellants have not shown\\nthat Caronni\\u2019s progressive processing system is incompatible with parallel\\nprocessing such that a combined system would be inoperable. Rather, we\\nagree with the Examiner (see Ans. 28-29) and \\ufb01nd that parallel processing\\nand Caronni\\u2019s progressive processing provide different, complementary\\nadvantages in a packet processing system. For example, parallel processing\\nis helpful when \\u201cthe accumulation of unprocessed data (e. g. email messages)\\nmay lead to bottlenecks, and ultimately loss of data if a processing node\\n\\ncannot properly handle the stream of data\\u201d (Caronni, 11 [0005]), andAppeal 2011-005376\\n\\nApplication ll/255,842\\n\\nprogressive processing is helpful for \\u201ckeeping the status of the processing\\nprogress on each data packet\\u201d (Caronni. $1 [0006]).\\n\\nFinally, we disagree with Appellants\\u2019 argument (App. Br. 16) that\\nneither reference discloses \\u201cprocessing said first portion of data at said \\ufb01rst\\nnode . . . according to first infonnation about said network,\\u201d as recited in\\nclaim 1. As the Examiner \\ufb01nds (Ans. 7, 32), Caronni discloses processing a\\nportion of data at a particular node \\u201cdepending on the availability of\\nprocessing resources\\u201d (Caronni, 1] [0009]). Further, Caronni discloses \\u201c[a]n\\nembodiment of the invention provides for delegation of partial processing to\\nprocessing nodes with available resources\\u201d (Caronni, 11 [001 1]). We agree\\nwith the Examiner (Ans. 7, 32) and \\ufb01nd that Caronni\\u2019s processing data\\ndepending on the available resources in the various nodes of the network\\nmeets the broad limitation of \\u201cprocessing . . . according to first information\\nabout said network.\\u201d\\n\\nWe are therefore not persuaded that the Examiner erred in rejecting\\n\\nclaim 1, and claims 2-30 not speci\\ufb01cally argued separately.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\\n\\nUnder the judicially created doctrine of non-statutory obviousness-\\ntype double patenting, the Examiner did not err in rejecting claims 1-4, 10-\\n17. 22-26, and 30.\\n\\nUnder 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a), the Examiner did not err in rejecting claims\\n1-30.\\n\\nDECISION\\n\\nThe Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting claims 1-30 is affirmed.Appeal 2011-005376\\nApplication 1 1/255,842\\n\\nNo time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with\\nthis appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iV).

Ans. 3.Appeal 2011-005895\\nApplication 11/386,128\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 invention relates to \\u201ca semiconductor substrate and in\\nparticular to a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate and a method of\\nforming an epitaxial layer thereon\\u201d (Spec. [000l]). The application of\\nsilicon carbide as a semiconductor material is said to be \\u201climited because of\\nhigh substrate defect density resulting in poor quality of epitaxially grown\\n\\ufb01lms which prevents the fabrication of large area devices\\u201d (id. at [0002]\\u201c).\\nAppellants\\u2019 semiconductor structure includes a masking layer over a\\n\\nsemiconductor layer and a coalescent epitaxial layer formed from an\\n\\nexposed surface of the semiconductor layer over the masking layer (App. Br.\\n\\n3-4, citing Figs. 1-6).\\nA copy of independent claims 19, 25, and 32, taken from the Claims\\nAppendix of the Appeal Brief, is set forth below:\\n\\n19. A structure comprising:\\nat least one semiconductor layer;\\n\\nat least one masking layer over the at least one\\nsemiconductor layer, wherein the at least one masking layer\\ncomprises a plurality of hexagonal shapes, wherein each of the\\nplurality of hexagonal shapes is isolated fro1n one another by\\nopenings therebetween; and\\n\\nat least one coalescent epitaxial layer fon11ed\\nprogressively from an exposed surface of the at least one\\nsemiconductor layer over the at least one masking layer.\\n\\n25. A structure comprising:\\nat least one semiconductor layer;\\n\\nat least one masking layer over the at least one\\nsemiconductor layer, wherein the at least one masking layer\\ncomprises a plurality of shapes, wherein each of the plurality ofAppeal 2011-005895\\nApplication 11/386,128\\n\\nshapes is isolated from one another by openings therebetween;\\nand\\n\\nat least one coalescent epitaxial layer fon11ed\\nprogressively from an exposed surface of the at least one\\nsemiconductor layer, wherein a defect density of the at least one\\nepitaxial layer is less than a defect density ofthe at least one\\nsemiconductor layer.\\n\\n32. A semiconductor device comprising:\\nat least one silicon carbide layer;\\n\\nat least one masking layer over the at least one silicon\\ncarbide layer, wherein the at least one masking layer comprises\\ngraphite or tantalum carbide in a plurality of shapes; and\\n\\nat least one silicon carbide epitaxial layer over the at least\\none masking layer and the at least one silicon carbide layer,\\nwherein the at least one silicon carbide epitaxial layer is\\ncoalescent.\\n\\nThe only speci\\ufb01c arguments advanced by Appellants in the record of\\nthis appeal relate to the rejections of independent claims 19, 25, and 32\\n(App. Br. 5-18). Each of commonly rejected dependent claims 20-24, 26-\\n31, 33, and 34 will stand or fall with the independent claim fro111 which it\\ndepends. 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 41 .37(c)(l)(vii).\\n\\nFor the reasons expressed in the Answer and below, we will sustain\\nthe rejections ofindependent claims l9, 25, and 32 and concomitantly the\\nrejections of the other claims on appeal.\\n\\nThe Anticipation Rejections\\nClaim 19\\nWith respect to claim 19, the Examiner finds that Kozaki and Kioke\\n\\neach discloses a structure comprising a semiconductor layer, a masking layerAppeal 2011-005895\\nApplication 11/386,128\\ncomprising a plurality of hexagonal shapes over the se111iconductor\\nlayer,de\\ufb01ning channels of exposed semiconductor substrate between the\\nshapes, and at least one coalescent epitaxial layer formed progressively from\\nan exposed surface of the semiconductor layer. Ans. 4 (citing Kozaki Figs.\\n1A, lD, 3A, col. 9, 11. 30-45), 6 (citing Kioke Figs. 2A, 2C, 10A).\\n\\nAppellants argue that the rejection over Kozaki should be reversed\\nsolely because \\u201cthe interpretation by the Examiner of claim 19 as a product-\\nby\\u2014process clai111 is erroneous since the \\u2018product\\u2019 in a \\u2018product\\u2014by\\u2014process\\u2019\\nclaim refers to the \\u2018claimed product,\\u2019 and not to any particular element that\\nis recited as part of the claimed claim.\\u201d App. Br. 6.\\n\\nAppellants argue that the rejection over Kioke should be reversed for\\nthe same basic reason. More speci\\ufb01cally, the Appellants argue the epitaxial\\ngrowth of the nitride compound semiconductor is\\n\\nnoljusl/i\\'0m the bottom surface of the post 31, but also from\\nthe top surface of the post 31, which is in sharp\\ncontradistinction to the teachings of the present claim, whereby\\n\\u201cat least one . . . epitaxial layer [is] formed progressively from\\nan exposed surface oft/7e at least one semiconductor layer over\\nthe at least one masking layer\\u201d.\\n\\nApp. Br. 7 (citing Kioke [00l9]).\\n\\nThe Examiner responds that \\u201csince Kozaki discloses all structural\\nlimitations of claims l9 and 25, including at least one coalescent epitaxial\\nlayer (Fig. 1D, numerals 4, 5), it anticipates these claims.\\u201d Ans. 12. The\\nExaminer explains that \\u201c[t]he phrase \\u2018formed progressively from an exposed\\nsurface of the at least one semiconductor layer\\u2019 is a product-by process\\nlimitation.\\u201d Id. Therefore, the patentability of the product claim is not\\n\\ndependent on the method by which it is produced.Appeal 2011-005895\\nApplication 11/386,128\\n\\nThe Examiner similarly responds to Appellants\\u2019 argument concerning\\nKoike. Id. In addition, the Examiner identi\\ufb01es in Kioke the disclosure of\\nthe epitaxial layer formed progressively from an exposed surface of the at\\nleast one semiconductor layer over the at least one masking layer. Id. at 13\\n(citing Kioke Fig. 2C numerals 2, 31, and 32, para. [0044]).\\n\\nAppellants\\u2019 argument that the process of making an element of the\\nclaim is not a process for making the claimed product is not persuasive. The\\nprocess of making a product necessarily involves the elements of the\\n\\nproduct. Appellants\\u2019 argument that the epitaxial growth in Kioke is \\u201cnotjust\\n\\nfrom the bottom surface of the post 31, but also fro111 the top surface of the\\n\\npost 31\\u201d (App. Br. 7) implicitly concedes Kioke discloses epitaxial growth\\nthat progresses from the bottom surface. Moreover Appellants do not\\ndispute that the epitaxial growth is over the at least one masking layer in\\nKioke and coalescent. Any structure, no matter how made, that is the same\\nas a structure formed by the process steps recited in a claim, suf\\ufb01ces to meet\\nthat structure for purposes of examination. See In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695,\\n697 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (noting that \\u201ceven though product-by-process claims\\nare limited by and de\\ufb01ned by the process, determination of patentability is\\nbased on the product itself\\u201d) Appellants have not argued, and have not\\ndirected us to any evidence showing the structure resulting fro111 the\\nprocesses of the applied art would be structurally or functionally\\ndistinguished fro111 the structure required by the claim.\\nFor the reasons expressed in the Answer and above, we sustain the\\n\\nrejection ofindependent claim 19 and concomitantly claims 20-24, which\\n\\ndepend therefrom.Appeal 2011-005895\\nApplication 11/386,128\\nClaim 25\\n\\nIn addition to \\ufb01ndings made with respect to claim 19, the Examiner\\nfurther \\ufb01nds that Kozaki and Kioke disclose \\u201ca defect density of the at least\\none epitaxial layer is less than a defect density of the at least one\\nsemiconductor layer.\\u201d Ans. 5 (citing Kozaki col. 10, 11. 30-45), 6 (citing\\nKioke [0020]).\\n\\nTo distinguish claim 25 over Kozaki and Kioke, Appellants rely on\\nthe sa111e arguments for claim 19 above. App. Br. 6, 8.\\n\\nFor the same reasons that we \\ufb01nd the preponderance of the evidence\\nsupports the Exan1iner\\u2019s determination that claim 19 is anticipated by\\nKozaki and Kioke, we sustain the rejection of claim 25 and concomitantly\\nclaims 26-31 which depend therefrom.\\n\\nClaim 32\\n\\nRegarding claim 32, the Examiner \\ufb01nds that Bhat teaches a\\nsemiconductor device comprising a silicon carbide layer, a masking layer\\ncomprising tantalum carbide in a plurality of shapes over the silicon carbide\\n\\nlayer, and at least one silicon carbide epitaxial layer that is coalescent over\\n\\nthe masking layer. Ans. 7 (citing Bhat Figs. 2A, 2E, [0025], [0028], [003l],\\n\\nand [003 5]).\\nConcerning the rejection ofclai111 32, Appellants state without\\nembellishment that\\n\\n[b]ased on a perusal of the cited sections, and indeed of\\nthe entire Bhat reference, and in sharp contrast to the claim\\nlanguage, the Applicant argues that the Bhat reference does not\\ndisclose the presently recited claim feature, whereby it is\\ndisclosed that the \\u201cat least one masking layer comprises . . .\\nwherein the at least one masking layer comprises . . . a plurality\\nofshczpes.\\u201dAppeal 2011-005895\\n\\nApplication 11/386,128\\n\\nApp. Br. 12. Such an unembellished statement is merely an unsupported\\nassertion. not an argument.\\n\\nln response, the Examiner correctly \\ufb01nds that the phrase \\u201cplurality of\\nshapes\" should be interpreted as \\u201chaving more than one opening (shapes), in\\nthe mask layer.\\u201d Ans. 13. Paragraph [0035] of Bhat (\\u201cmultiple openings in\\nthe mask 204\\u201d) as well as paragraph [0025] of Appellants\\u2019 Speci\\ufb01cation that\\nrefers to the hexagonal shapes in Fi g. 5 as a plurality of shapes support the\\nExaminer\\u2019s interpretation of claim 32. See id.\\n\\nFor the reasons expressed in the Answer, we will sustain the rejection\\nof independent clai111 32 and concomitantly claim 34, which depends\\ntherefrom.\\n\\nThe ()bviousness Rejections\\n\\nRegarding clai111 19, the Examiner finds that Bhat does not \\u201cexplicitly\\ndisclose that shapes of the masking layer are hexagonal.\\u201d Ans. 8. The\\nExaminer determines it would have been obvious for one of ordinary skill in\\nthe art at the time of the invention to modify Bhat with Kozaki\\u2019s teaching to\\nuse a \\u201cmasking layer with hexagonal shapes for the purpose of promoting\\ngrowth of epitaxial layer in many directions and easing peeling off the\\nsupporting substrate.\\u201d Id. at 8-9 (citing Kozaki col. 8, ll. 4-] 1).\\n\\nWith respect to claim 25, the Examiner also \\ufb01nds that Bhat does not\\ndisclose a defect density of the epitaxial layer is less than a defect density of\\nthe semiconductor layer, but does disclose overgrown epitaxial layer. Id. at\\n9 (citing Bhat [0035]\\u2018). The Examiner finds that Khlebnikov teaches that\\n\\u201clateral overgrown epilayer has a lower defect density than the defect\\ndensity in the substrate\\u201d (id. (citing Khlebnikov 119, col. 2, para. 1)). The\\n\\nExaminer determines that itAppeal 2011-005895\\nApplication 11/386,128\\n\\nwould have been therefore obvious to one of ordinary skill in\\nthe art at the time the invention was made to modify Bhat with\\nKhlebnikov to have a defect density in the epitaxial layer less\\nthan a defect density in the substrate for the purpose of for111ing\\nhighly efficient semiconductor devices.\\n\\nId. at 9-10.\\n\\nIn contesting the proposed combination of Bhat with Kozaki,\\nAppellants argue that \\u201cthe orientation referred to in Bhat is the orientation of\\nthe mask sides or \\u2018walls\\u2019 with respect to the orientation of the underlying\\nsubstrate crystal directions, and not the orientation of the sides or \\u2018walls\\u2019 of\\nthe mask with respect to each other.\\u201d App. Br. l7. Appellants further argue\\nthat the term \\u201cshape . . . refers to the shape of the \\u2018solid\\u2019 portions of the\\nmasking layer.\\u201d Id. (citing Spec. para. [00l6]).\\n\\nAppellants contend that the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 25 over\\nthe combination of Bhat and Khlebnikov because Bhat does not disclose the\\nclaimed \\u201cat least one masking layer co111prises a plurality of shapes\\u201d and\\nKhlebnikov \\u201cmerely state[s] that \\u2018 . . .

Accordingly, all the appealed claims stand or fall together with\\nclai111 1.\\n\\nWe have thoroughly reviewed each of Appellants\\u2018 arguments for\\npatentability. However, we are in complete agreement with the Examiner\\nthat the claimed subject matter would have been obvious to one of ordinary\\nskill in the art Within the meaning of \\xa7 103 in View of tl1e applied prior art.\\nAccordingly. we will sustain the Examiner\\'s rejections for the reasons set\\nforth in the Answer, and we add the following for emphasis only.\\n\\nPashley, like Appellants, discloses an illumination syste111 having a\\nlower portion comprising facets (50) which collimate the emitted light\\nthrough the surface of a dielectric material (8) into an upper portion\\ncomprising a facetted light-re\\ufb02ector. Hence, we agree with the Examiner\\nthat Pashley fairly discloses the claimed facetted light-collimator merging\\ninto a facetted light-reflector such that the collimator is between the facetted\\nlight-re\\ufb02ector and the light source.\\n\\nAppellants do not contest the Examiner\\'s legal conclusion that it\\nwould have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. based on the\\n\\ncollective teachings of Pashley and Vaganov, to have made the facettedAppeal 2011-007468\\nApplication 1 l/575,513\\n\\nlight-collimator of Pashley with a non-gaseous, optically transparent\\ndielectric material (Ans. 4, last para.). The principal argument advanced by\\nAppellants is that claim l on appeal \"clearly recites two distinct elements: a\\nfacetted ligl1t\\u2014colli111ator and a facetted light\\u2014re\\ufb02ector, and requires that the\\nfacetted light-collimator is between the facetted light\\u2014re\\ufb02ector and the light\\nsource\" (Prin. Br. 6, second para.), whereas Figure 2 of Pashley clearly\\ndepicts a single piece re\\ufb02ector. Appellants\\u2019 argument, however, is not\\ngermane to the claimed subject matter.\\n\\nAppealed clai111 1 does not de\\ufb01ne the facetted ligl1t\\u2014colli111ator and the\\nfacetted light\\u2014re\\ufb02ector as two distinct elements. The claim only requires a\\nfacetted ligl1t\\u2014colli111ator that merges into a facetted ligl1t\\u2014re\\ufb02ector at a side\\nfacing away from the light source. As noted above, Pashley fairly describes\\nthe collimator in the lower portion of the device merging into the facetted\\nreflector in the upper portion of the device above the surface of the dielectric\\nmaterial (8). Also, the Examiner correctly points out that it has generally\\nbeen held that the recitation of an integral structure does not preclude it\\nconsisting of various elements.\\n\\nAppellants also contend that the bottom surface of the bottom part of\\nPashley\\'s re\\ufb02ector is not merging into the top part of the re\\ufb02ector. However,\\nthis does not negate the fact that the reference device comprises a facetted\\nlight-collimator below the surface (8) merging into a facetted ligl1t-re\\ufb02ector\\nlocated above surface (8), thereby meeting the clai111 requirement of a\\nfacetted ligl1t\\u2014colli111ator situated between a light source and a facetted light-\\nre\\ufb02ector. It is immaterial whether re\\ufb02ectors are also located on the other\\n\\nside of the light source at the bottom of Pashley\\'s device.Appeal 2011-007468\\nApplication 1 1/575,513\\n\\nAs a \\ufb01nal point, we note that Appellants base no argument upon\\nobjective evidence of nonobviousness, such as unexpected results.\\n\\nIn conclusion, based on the foregoing and the reasons well stated by\\nthe Examiner, the Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting the appealed clai111s is\\naf\\ufb01rmed.\\n\\nThe decision of tl1e Examiner is affirmed.\\n\\nNo time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with\\nthis appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 l.l36(a)(l )(iv).\\n\\nAFFIRMED\\n\\nC am'},\n",

DIXON, Administrative Patent Judge.  DECISION ON APPEAL   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013478 Application 11/255,762   2STATEMENT OF THE CASE Appellants appeal under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 134(a) from a rejection of claims 1-30.  We have jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 6(b).   We affirm.  INVENTION The invention is directed to streaming media data (Spec. 1:18-19).  Claim 1, reproduced below, is representative of the claimed subject matter: 1. In a network comprising a first node, a second node, and a communication path between said first and second nodes, a method of processing data at said first node, said method comprising:  accessing data comprising a plurality of data packets; and  processing said data according to information about said data, according to information about said first node and said second node, and according to network observation information about said network, said network observation information descriptive of conditions in said network, wherein said information about said data for a particular data packet of said plurality of data packets remains constant for said data packet.  REFERENCES The prior art relied upon by the Examiner in rejecting the claims on appeal is: Syvanne  Caronni  Smith U.S. 2002/0112188 A1  U.S. 2002/0143850 A1  U.S. 2006/0268732 A1 Aug. 15, 2002  Oct. 3, 2002  Nov. 30, 2006  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013478 Application 11/255,762   3REJECTION Claims 1-30 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. \\xa7 103(a) as being unpatentable over Caronni, Smith, and Syvanne.  ANALYSIS Claims 1, 2, 9, 11-16, 18-20, 23-25, and 28-30  Regarding independent claim 1, Appellants contend that \\u201cCaronni teaches away from \\u2018processing said data according to information about said data . . . wherein said information about said data for a particular data packet of said plurality of data packets remains constant for said data packet\\u2019\\u201d because Caronni\\u2019s system updates progress indicators for tracking processing progress of data packets (App. Br. 11-14).  Appellants also contend that neither Smith nor Syvanne overcomes Caronni\\u2019s teaching away from the disputed feature of information that \\u201cremains constant for said data packet\\u201d (See App. Br. 14-17).  Syvanne discloses processing a data packet \\u201cby comparing header information of the data packet to the rules\\u201d (Syvanne, \\xb6 [0046]), which the Examiner finds meets the limitation of \\u201cprocessing said data according to information about said data . . . wherein said information . . . remains constant for said data packet\\u201d as recited in claim 1 (Ans. 6, 23).  As the Examiner notes (Ans. 22), Appellants do not contend that Syvanne fails to disclose this feature for which it is relied upon, but rather argue that Caronni teaches away from Syvanne\\u2019s feature of processing a data packet by comparing the packet\\u2019s header with certain rules (See App. Br. 14-17; Reply Br. 4-7).   \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013478 Application 11/255,762   4We disagree with Appellants\\u2019 argument that Caronni\\u2019s disclosure of updating a progress indicator for tracking the processing progress of a data packet teaches away from using Syvanne\\u2019s header information for processing a data packet.  Caronni discloses \\u201c[a] [p]rogress indicator contains information and references to information enabling the system to track processing progress.  In an embodiment of the present invention the progress indicator is a data structure that is attached to data packets.\\u201d  (Caronni, \\xb6 [0027]).  Appellants have not persuasively shown that the use of Caronni\\u2019s progress indicator in a data packet precludes processing the data packet by using some other, unchanging information in the packet header.  Rather, we see no incompatibility between the two separate, complementary functions provided by Syvanne\\u2019s data packet header information, which is used to determine what processing to do, and Caronni\\u2019s progress indicator, which is used to keep track of the processing that has been done.  We are therefore not persuaded that the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 1, and claims 2, 9, 11-16, 18-20, 23-25, and 28-30 not specifically argued separately.  Claims 3-8, 10, 17, 21, 22, 26, and 27  Regarding dependent claim 3, Appellants contend that Caronni teaches away from \\u201cusing information about said network to select a node from said second and third nodes,\\u201d and that Smith and Syvanne are silent with respect to this feature (App. Br. 17-19).  We disagree with Appellants.  The Examiner relies on Smith for disclosing this feature (Ans. 7).  Specifically, Smith discloses  \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013478 Application 11/255,762   5The distribution of data to the various analysis processors as well as the specific analysis performed at those processors can be adjusted on-the-fly and can be based, by way of example, on current network conditions . . . . In an embodiment where multiple processors are analyzing the same network data, it can be desirable for a communication path to exist between the processors so that they may coordinate an efficient means of dividing the workload of analysis processing (e.g., load balancing.).   (Smith, \\xb6 [0096]).  Appellants do not specifically explain why this passage fails to disclose the claim 3 feature for which it is relied upon.  Moreover, Appellants\\u2019 argument that Caronni teaches away from Smith\\u2019s load balancing is not persuasive.  The fact that Caronni discloses \\u201cdata is forwarded to the next node\\u201d (App. Br. 18) does not teach away from selecting one of multiple nodes to which to forward the data.  Rather, Caronni discloses multiple interconnected nodes to which data may be forwarded based on available resources (see Caronni, \\xb6 [0039]).  We are therefore not persuaded that the Examiner erred in rejecting claim 3, and claims 4-8, 10, 17, 21, 22, 26, and 27 not specifically argued separately.  CONCLUSION The Examiner does not err in rejecting claims 1-30 under 35 U.S.C.  \\xa7 103(a).  DECISION The Examiner\\u2019s decision rejecting claims 1-30 is affirmed. \\x0c\\nAppeal 2011-013478 Application 11/255,762   6No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. \\xa7 1.136(a)(1)(iv).
